## 1. Introduction

This guide documents the current custom track format used by Top Speed and is based on the current parser and runtime code paths. It is written as an authoring reference, not a marketing overview, so the goal is practical correctness.

A custom track file controls four things at once: the road shape and surface flow, the active weather model and its transition behavior, the acoustic room profile applied while driving through segments, and optional custom sound sources placed on the track. Each of those systems is linked through ids and validated before the track is accepted.

This means track authoring is not only about writing valid keys. You also need to understand which keys are actually consumed by runtime, which keys are only metadata, how clamping changes extreme values, and which references must exist up front.

<a id="sec-2-how-to-imagine-a-track-shape-as-an-author"></a>
## 2. How to Imagine a Track Shape as an Author

The most accurate mental model is a timeline of segments that is replayed in a loop. Segment order is the track order. Segment length is physical distance in meters. Turn type changes how fast the lane center drifts left or right as the player moves through that segment.

`straight` keeps lateral center drift at zero. Left and right curves apply continuous drift with different strengths. Because drift is evaluated across segment length, long segments create larger accumulated center movement than short segments with the same turn type.

Current curve-strength factors used by runtime are:

- `straight`: `0`
- `easy_left` / `easy_right`: `0.5`
- `left` / `right`: `0.6667`
- `hard_left` / `hard_right`: `1.0`
- `hairpin_left` / `hairpin_right`: `1.5`

Segment width is separate from turn shape. If `width > 0`, that segment uses its own width. If `width <= 0`, runtime falls back to the default lane width. This matters for track feel because the exact same turn sequence can feel forgiving or punishing depending on width profile.

A practical workflow is to first author only segment sequence, length, and width, then drive and tune pacing. Add weather, rooms, and custom sounds after geometry feels right.

<a id="sec-3-folder-layout-file-discovery-and-loading-rules"></a>
## 3. Folder Layout, File Discovery, and Loading Rules

Custom loading accepts either a folder path or a file path. If you pass a folder, loader scans that folder for `*.tsm` and picks the first filename in case-insensitive sort order. If you pass a file path, it must be a `.tsm` file that exists inside an existing folder.

Recommended layout:

```text
Tracks/
  MyTrack/
    track.tsm
    Audio/
      ambience_loop.ogg
      birds_1.ogg
```

Sound paths in sound sections are resolved relative to the folder containing the `tsm` file. They are not resolved from the game root and not resolved from the Sounds asset root. This keeps each custom track self-contained.

Display name resolution for custom tracks follows this order:

1. `meta.name` if defined and non-empty.
2. Parent folder name.
3. Filename without extension.

<a id="sec-4-tsm-file-format-rules"></a>
## 4. TSM File Format Rules

TSM is line-based and supports exactly two statement forms: section headers and key-value assignments.

Section header format:

```text
[kind]
[kind:id]
```

Key-value format:

```text
key = value
```

Inline comments start with `#` and are stripped before parsing. Empty lines are ignored.

Supported section kinds are `meta`, `segment`, `weather`, `room`, and `sound`. `segment`, `weather`, `room`, and `sound` require ids (`[kind:id]`). `meta` does not use an id (`[meta]`).

Unknown section kinds fail validation. Unknown keys in strict sections also fail validation, except extension-style keys that start with `meta` or `metadata`.

Section order is flexible. The parser reads top-to-bottom and finalizes each section object when a new section header starts. Repeating a key in the same section is allowed; the later value overrides the earlier value for that section object.

Key and section-kind parsing is normalized to lower-case, and spaces/hyphens become underscores. IDs are trimmed and matched case-insensitively. ID uniqueness is enforced per section family (`segment`, `weather`, `room`, `sound`), so duplicate ids in the same family are validation errors.

<a id="sec-5-sections-and-how-they-connect"></a>
## 5. Sections and How They Connect

At least one segment section is required. Also, `meta.weather` is required and must point to an existing weather profile id. If either is missing, the track is rejected.

Segments are the backbone and can reference:

- weather profile ids
- room ids or built-in room preset names
- sound source ids

Sound sources can reference segment ids with `start_area` and `end_area`, so segment ids are used by both geometry and audio trigger logic.

Room behavior has two override layers:

- room section values override room preset baseline
- segment room override keys override the selected room only for that segment

Weather behavior also has two layers:

- track-level default profile from `meta.weather`
- optional segment-level weather id with optional blend time (`weather_transition_seconds`)

<a id="sec-6-detailed-key-reference"></a>
## 6. Detailed Key Reference

<a id="sec-6-1-meta-section"></a>
## 6.1 Meta Section

Header syntax for this section is `[meta]`.

`name`
This is the display name used for the custom track in menus and announcements.
Allowed values:
- Any non-empty text value.

`version`
This is optional author metadata for your own revisioning.
It is stored with track data but does not change runtime driving/audio behavior by itself.
Allowed values:
- Any non-empty text value.

`weather`
This is the required default weather profile id for the track.
Allowed values:
- Any existing weather section id.
- Example: if the file contains `[weather:clear]`, then `weather = clear` is valid.
- If the id does not exist, loading fails.

`ambience`
This selects the legacy ambience loop family.
Allowed values:
- `none`
  Disables legacy ambience loop playback.
- `desert`
  Uses the desert ambience loop behavior.
- `airport`
  Uses the airport ambience loop behavior.

Alias values:

- `noambience`: `none`
- `1`: `desert`
- `2`: `airport`

## 6.2 Weather Profile Sections

Header syntax is `[weather:<id>]`, for example `[weather:clear]`.

`kind`
This picks the base preset for the profile.
When this key is set, runtime first loads the preset values, then applies any explicit numeric keys in the same weather section.

`rain_gain`
This sets rain-loop weather intensity gain for the profile.
Allowed values:
- Any numeric value greater than or equal to `0`.

Runtime note: profile stores `0..4` after clamping; playback path currently applies final `0..1` clamp before source volume.

`wind_gain`
This sets wind-loop weather intensity gain for the profile.
Allowed values:
- Any numeric value greater than or equal to `0`.

Runtime note: profile stores `0..4` after clamping; playback path currently applies final `0..1` clamp before source volume.

`storm_gain`
This sets storm-loop weather intensity gain for the profile.
Allowed values:
- Any numeric value greater than or equal to `0`.

Runtime note: profile stores `0..4` after clamping; playback path currently applies final `0..1` clamp before source volume.

Weather switching behavior:
When a segment sets `weather = some_id`, runtime blends toward that profile.
Blend speed is controlled by segment key `weather_transition_seconds`.

<a id="sec-6-6-value-parsing-and-token-rules"></a>
## 6.6 Value Parsing and Token Rules

Numeric parsing is invariant-culture, so decimals must use `.`.  
Enum parsing is case-insensitive and tolerant of spaces/hyphens/underscores in token text.  
Boolean parsing accepts `1/0`, `true/false`, `yes/no`, and `on/off`.

Vector keys must be exactly three comma-separated float values (`x,y,z`).  
Unknown keys are validation errors in strict sections unless key name starts with `meta` or `metadata`.  
Sound path safety rules reject rooted paths, drive letters, and traversal segments (`.` and `..` path components).  
Cross-reference validation runs after parse and ensures referenced weather ids, room ids, segment ids, and sound ids all exist.

## 7. Room Reverb Model and Full Preset Catalog

<a id="sec-7-1-reverb-parameter-meanings"></a>
## 7.1 Reverb Parameter Meanings

This section explains each room parameter in plain language.

| Parameter | What it controls | What happens when increased |
|---|---|---|
| `reverb_time_seconds` | How long the reverb tail lasts before fading out. | The space sounds longer and more lingering. |
| `reverb_gain` | Overall strength of the reverb return. | Reflections become louder compared to the dry signal. |
| `hf_decay_ratio` | How long high frequencies survive in the tail relative to the rest. | High-frequency content stays brighter for longer. |
| `late_reverb_gain` | Level of the late, dense tail component. | The late reverb body becomes stronger and more obvious. |
| `diffusion` | How dense/smooth early and late reflections feel. | Reflections sound less discrete and more blended/smooth. |
| `air_absorption` | High-frequency loss caused by distance through air. | Distant sound loses more brightness and clarity. |
| `occlusion_scale` | How strongly obstacles reduce direct sound. | Obstacle blocking effect becomes stronger. |
| `transmission_scale` | How much sound passes through walls/structures. | More through-boundary sound leakage is audible. |

<a id="sec-7-2-full-built-in-room-presets-all-66"></a>

## 9. Validation and Troubleshooting

Track loading has a strict validation phase before runtime objects are built. Errors stop loading. Warnings allow loading but values may be adjusted by clamp rules.

Common hard failures and direct fixes:

| Failure | Why it happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing default weather profile | `meta.weather` is empty or points to unknown id | Define `weather = some_id` in `meta` and add `[weather:some_id]` section |
| Duplicate section ids | Two sections in same family reuse same id | Rename ids so each `segment`, `weather`, `room`, and `sound` id is unique |
| Unknown enum token | Value text does not map to a supported enum token/int | Use valid token or numeric enum value from this guide |
| Unknown key in strict section | Misspelled key or unsupported key name | Correct spelling; keep custom tags under `meta*` / `metadata*` prefix |
| Unknown reference id | Segment or sound references id that does not exist | Add missing target section or fix reference id text |
| Invalid sound path | Absolute path, drive-letter path, or traversal path | Use track-relative path only, for example `Audio/wind.ogg` |
| Invalid vector | Position value is not exactly `x,y,z` floats | Write exactly three float values separated by commas |

Important non-fatal behavior:

- Segment lengths below 50 are warned and clamped up to 50.
- Many room and weather gain fields are clamped in runtime constructors.
- `pitch <= 0` for sound sources becomes `1.0`.
- `width <= 0` does not fail; runtime falls back to default lane width.

## 10. Practical Authoring Workflow

A stable workflow is to build in four passes and test after each pass instead of writing all systems at once.

Pass 1 is geometry only: `meta`, one weather profile, and segments with `type`, `length`, `surface`, `width`. Confirm pacing, curve flow, and lap feel.

Pass 2 is weather transitions: add extra weather profiles, then add segment-level `weather` and `weather_transition_seconds` only where transitions are intentional. Confirm transitions are smooth and occur at expected segment boundaries.

Pass 3 is acoustics: add room presets or room sections for specific areas like tunnels and enclosed structures. If needed, use segment room overrides for local tuning instead of duplicating many room sections.

Pass 4 is sound sources: start with one simple source with known good file path, then add spatial behavior, area triggers, and random variants. Validate each sound id reference from segments and area ids from sound triggers.

Keep a companion plain-text sequence that describes segment order, distance, and intent. When behavior is wrong, compare the sequence against runtime behavior to isolate whether the problem is geometry, weather ids, room selection, or sound trigger references.
