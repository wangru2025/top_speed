## 1. Introduction

This guide explains how vehicles work in the current Top Speed rewrite and how to create custom vehicles using the new strict `.tsv` vehicle package format (TopSpeedVehicle). It is written for beginners, especially blind players and modders using screen readers, and it assumes only basic knowledge of acceleration, braking, and gears.

The main goal is practical understanding. You should be able to read this document, understand what the game is simulating, create a valid vehicle file, and tune the vehicle so it feels good in gameplay without needing advanced math or real-world engineering training.

Top Speed now uses a force-based driving model with explicit powertrain modules. The game calculates acceleration from engine torque, gearing, drivetrain efficiency, tire circumference, traction, drag, rolling resistance, and braking forces, then applies transmission-family coupling and shift logic. Some parameter names are inherited from older versions of the game, but the custom vehicle format itself is now fully redesigned and strict. There is no backward compatibility with old vehicle files.

That means three important things for authors. First, all values are entered directly as real numbers, not encoded legacy numbers that get divided by 100. Second, every parameter must be inside a supported section. Third, invalid or extreme values are rejected with line-aware error messages instead of being silently accepted.

This guide is split into five parts. It starts with the physics model used by the game, then explains how to create a custom vehicle package and file, then explains the parser and validation rules, then gives a detailed parameter reference grouped by section with allowed value ranges and tuning advice, and finally provides class baseline presets for the modern steering and tire dynamics model.

## 2. How Vehicle Physics Works in Top Speed

<a id="sec-2-1-the-big-picture"></a>
## 2.1 The Big Picture

When a vehicle accelerates in Top Speed, the game is not simply adding a fixed speed amount. It builds acceleration from forces. The engine produces torque, the torque is multiplied by the current gear and final drive, that torque becomes wheel force, and the wheel force is limited by traction. After that, the game subtracts forces that resist motion, mainly rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. The remaining force is converted into acceleration by dividing by vehicle mass.

This is why two vehicles with similar top speed targets can feel very different. If one vehicle is heavy, tall-geared, and has low torque at the RPM where it lands after a shift, it can feel lazy even if its `max_speed` value is high. Another vehicle can feel very quick with a lower `max_speed` reference if it has short gearing, stronger midrange torque, and lower mass.

The game also runs a separate steering and lateral movement model. Steering is influenced by `steering_response`, `max_steer_deg`, `wheelbase`, and high-speed window values, while actual sideways response is limited and shaped by `[tire_model]` and `[dynamics]` values. At high speed, the shared steering model now applies built-in attenuation first, then applies `high_speed_steer_gain` only as a bounded boost to that attenuated baseline. This keeps high-speed steering stable while still allowing class tuning.

Transmission behavior is now split into two layers. The first layer is vehicle definition (`[transmission]` plus type-specific `[transmission_*]` sections), which defines what transmission family the vehicle supports and how that family couples engine RPM to wheel RPM. The second layer is automatic shift policy (`[policy]`), which decides *when* automatic mode shifts. Policy improves decisions, but it cannot create engine power that is not there.

Manual and automatic families now follow different driveline physics. Manual mode uses clutch state and can stall at low speed/high load when clutch is engaged in an unsuitable gear. Automatic families use type-specific coupling models (ATC, DCT, CVT), including launch coupling behavior, lock thresholds, and in ATC/CVT the low-speed creep behavior.

The format is also split by responsibility. Core engine limits live in `[engine]`, torque curve shape in `[torque]` and `[torque_curve]`, rotational engine behavior in `[engine_rot]`, and chassis/air resistance in `[resistance]`. Keeping these sections separate makes tuning safer and easier to reason about.

<a id="sec-2-2-units-used-by-the-game"></a>
## 2.2 Units Used by the Game

This section exists because many tuning mistakes come from unit confusion, not from bad physics ideas. The easiest way to think about units is that they are the language used by the simulation. If a value is entered in the wrong unit, the game still runs, but the result feels wrong in ways that are hard to diagnose.

The game is player-facing in km/h for speed, but internally it still uses standard physics units for force and motion. You do not need to do advanced math while authoring, but you do need to know what each unit means in plain language.

`kg` (kilogram) is mass. In this guide, `mass_kg=1500` means the car has 1500 kg of mass, and that directly affects how much acceleration you get from the same force. Heavier vehicles need more force to feel equally quick.

`Nm` (Newton-meter) is torque. It is twisting strength. If you imagine a wrench on a bolt, torque is how strongly you twist that wrench. In the game, engine torque is what the engine can produce at a given RPM before gearing multiplies it.

`N` (Newton) is force. Wheel force is what actually pushes the vehicle forward on the road after torque has been converted through wheel radius. Acceleration comes from net force after resistance is removed.

`m` (meter) is distance, and `m^2` (square meter) is area. `wheelbase` is in meters, and `frontal_area` is in square meters. Frontal area is used with drag coefficient to model how strongly air resists the vehicle at speed.

`rpm` means revolutions per minute. It is how fast the engine is spinning, not how powerful the engine is by itself. RPM decides where you are on the torque curve.

`m/s^2` is acceleration or deceleration rate. The physics model uses it for forces that turn into vehicle slowdown or acceleration over time.

`kg*m^2` (written as `kgm2` in key names like `inertia_kgm2`) is rotational inertia. This is one of the most confusing units for beginners, so treat it simply: it controls how quickly RPM can change. Higher inertia means slower RPM rise and slower RPM fall. Lower inertia means the engine revs up and down faster.

You may also see `km/h/s` in some transmission keys such as `creep_accel_kphps`. That unit means "how many km/h of speed are added each second" during creep behavior.

The new custom format uses direct values only. There is no legacy divide-by-100 encoding. If you want 170 km/h target speed, write `max_speed=170`. If you want 0.10 traction factor, write `surface_traction_factor=0.10`. If you want steering response of 1.8, write `steering_response=1.8`.

If you are unsure about a key, read its unit first, then tune. In practice, this single habit prevents many unrealistic results.

<a id="sec-2-3-the-main-acceleration-flow-plain-language"></a>
## 2.3 The Main Acceleration Flow (Plain Language)

The game uses a sequence of calculations each frame while throttle is applied.

The first step is determining the engine RPM for the current vehicle speed and gear. RPM depends on road speed, tire circumference, current gear ratio, final drive ratio, and driveline coupling mode (locked, blended, or disengaged). At low speed under throttle, a launch RPM floor can help prevent the engine from dropping too low and feeling weak right off the line.

The next step is reading engine torque from the engine torque curve. The torque curve can be built from a preset shape plus overrides in `[torque_curve]`, or from direct per-RPM points. It still works with the core torque values (`idle_torque`, `peak_torque`, `peak_torque_rpm`, and `redline_torque`) and the RPM range between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`.

That engine torque is multiplied by the current gear ratio and the `final_drive` ratio, then reduced by `drivetrain_efficiency`. This gives wheel torque. Wheel torque is then converted into wheel force using tire radius derived from tire circumference.

The wheel force is capped by grip. Even if the engine could theoretically push harder, the tires can only transmit so much force to the road. That is where `tire_grip`, surface behavior, and related handling values matter.

Finally, the game subtracts resistance forces. Rolling resistance acts all the time and is noticeable at lower speeds. Aerodynamic drag grows rapidly with speed and becomes dominant near top speed. The remaining force becomes acceleration after dividing by `mass_kg`.

During lift-off and coast, the runtime computes total deceleration from multiple components: aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, wheel-side resistance, coupled driveline drag when connected, engine-brake transfer through gearing, and optional brake input. This is why high-gear lift-off, low-gear lift-off, and neutral coast can now behave differently but still remain physically consistent.

The result is a system where low-speed acceleration, mid-speed pull, and high-speed pull can all be tuned differently using different parameters.

## 2.4 RPM, Torque, and Why Some Gears Feel Stronger Than Others

<a id="sec-2-4-1-rpm"></a>
## 2.4.1 RPM

RPM means how many full turns the engine crankshaft makes in one minute. If the engine is at 3000 RPM, the crankshaft is making 3000 turns per minute. That number is easy to read in logs, but the important point is what it means for torque. Every engine has stronger and weaker parts of its RPM range, so RPM tells you where the engine currently lives on that strength map.

In gameplay terms, RPM explains why one shift feels strong and another shift feels dead. After an upshift, RPM always drops. That is normal. The question is where it lands. If it lands near the useful torque region, the vehicle keeps pulling. If it lands too low, the vehicle feels lazy until RPM climbs back up.

This is also why simply raising `rev_limiter` is not always a fix. A higher limiter gives longer gears, but if torque falls hard near the top or shift landing is too low, drivability may get worse. Good tuning is not "highest RPM possible." Good tuning is "RPM lands in a usable part of the curve across real shifts."

<a id="sec-2-4-2-torque"></a>
## 2.4.2 Torque

Torque is the engine's twisting strength. A beginner-friendly way to picture it is this: torque is what tries to rotate the drivetrain, and the drivetrain turns that rotation into push at the tires. In Top Speed, torque is not directly equal to acceleration. It must pass through gearing, efficiency, traction limits, and resistance first.

The order matters. The engine first produces torque at the current RPM from the torque curve. That torque is then scaled by `power_factor`, multiplied by gear ratio and `final_drive`, and reduced by `drivetrain_efficiency`. After that, wheel torque is converted into forward wheel force. Only then can the game compare that force against traction and resistance. The leftover force, divided by mass, is acceleration.

This is why two vehicles with similar peak torque can feel completely different. A vehicle with short gearing and good midrange torque can feel very alive. A vehicle with tall gearing and weak post-shift RPM landing can feel flat, even if the peak torque number looks large on paper.

Worked example (simplified):

1. Engine torque at current RPM is `300 Nm`.
2. `power_factor=0.80`, so effective engine torque becomes `240 Nm`.
3. Gear ratio `2.20` and `final_drive=3.50` give wheel torque before losses: `240 * 2.20 * 3.50 = 1848 Nm`.
4. With `drivetrain_efficiency=0.88`, wheel torque becomes `1626.24 Nm`.
5. With wheel radius `0.34 m`, wheel force is `1626.24 / 0.34 = 4783 N`.
6. If resistance at that moment is `1800 N`, net force is `2983 N`.
7. With `mass_kg=1500`, acceleration is `2983 / 1500 = 1.99 m/s^2`.

In tuning practice, this explains why "just lower peak torque" is often the wrong first reaction. If the vehicle is only too strong near top speed, adjust high-RPM torque shape or resistance first. If launch is weak but upper pull is fine, adjust low-band torque and gearing first. Torque tuning works best when you target the wrong speed region, not the whole curve blindly.

The runtime also tracks gross and net engine output. Gross torque is what the combustion side produces from the curve. Net torque subtracts internal losses such as friction and overrun. This is why near idle you can still have stable RPM behavior while reported net horsepower is low.

<a id="sec-2-4-3-horsepower-gross-vs-net"></a>
## 2.4.3 Horsepower (Gross vs Net)

Horsepower is a derived value that combines torque and RPM into one "rate of work" number. In this project, horsepower is not a primary input key. It is calculated from torque and RPM using `horsepower = (torque_nm * rpm) / 7127`.

A practical way to read this is that torque tells you "how strong the twist is," while RPM tells you "how fast that twist is happening." You need both to understand engine output at a moment in time. For example, `260 Nm` at `2000 RPM` and `260 Nm` at `5000 RPM` are not the same horsepower.

The runtime publishes two variants: gross horsepower and net horsepower. Gross horsepower comes from gross torque before internal losses. Net horsepower comes after friction and overrun losses are subtracted. This distinction is important when debugging logs. If the engine is near idle or the player lifted throttle at high RPM, net output can look much smaller than expected, or even negative briefly, while gross output still reflects the underlying torque curve behavior.

<a id="sec-2-4-4-why-gear-multiplication-changes-wheel-torque"></a>
## 2.4.4 Why Gear Multiplication Changes Wheel Torque

Engine torque is produced at the crankshaft. Wheel torque is:

- engine torque
- multiplied by current gear ratio
- multiplied by `final_drive`
- multiplied by `drivetrain_efficiency`

So at the same engine torque, lower gears (numerically higher ratios) usually produce more wheel torque than higher gears. This is why first and second gear feel strong.

If you are comparing logs at the same *vehicle speed*, a higher gear can still sometimes show healthy pull if that gear lands the engine in a stronger torque zone while the lower gear is near torque fade or limiter. So the correct rule is:

- lower gears multiply torque more
- actual acceleration depends on where RPM lands on the torque curve and what resistance dominates at that speed

This also explains a common confusion:

- "Why is torque higher in higher gears?"  
  Usually what changes is *engine* torque at the new RPM point, not gear multiplication itself. Higher gears reduce multiplication, but if RPM lands closer to peak torque, engine-side torque can increase while wheel torque still drops compared with a lower gear at the same engine state.

For tuning, always distinguish:

- engine torque (`[torque]` + `[torque_curve]`)
- wheel torque (engine torque after ratio multipliers and efficiency)
- acceleration (wheel force after traction limits and total resistance)

<a id="sec-2-4-5-engine-behavior-by-driving-state"></a>
## 2.4.5 Engine Behavior by Driving State

The same vehicle can produce very different RPM and horsepower logs depending on whether the engine is mechanically tied to the wheels. This is normal, and understanding it removes a lot of confusion during tuning.

When the vehicle is in neutral or the clutch is disengaged, wheel speed does not strongly force engine RPM. The engine behaves like a mostly free rotating body. Throttle adds torque, friction removes torque, overrun may add extra loss during lift-off, and `inertia_kgm2` decides how quickly RPM can rise or fall. In this state, odd free-rev behavior usually points to `[engine_rot]` keys, not to drag or rolling resistance.

When the vehicle is coupled in gear, RPM is no longer free. Wheel speed, tire circumference, and overall ratio demand a coupled RPM. If road load is high and available torque is low, the engine can be pulled down toward lower RPM even while throttle is applied. This is why a vehicle can feel fine in one gear and weak in another without any bug: the engine may simply be landing in a weaker torque region for that ratio.

In automatic launch conditions, ATC, DCT, and CVT families can apply low-speed coupling behavior and minimum-coupled RPM assistance. The goal is to avoid the classic engage-drive bog where RPM collapses under idle before recovering. If launch surges too hard, inspect launch and coupling controls. If launch feels lazy or dips under idle, inspect low-RPM torque support and coupling floor behavior.

Lift-off behavior also depends on state. In gear, the vehicle sees aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, wheel-side drag, possible coupled driveline drag, and engine-brake transfer through the current ratio. In neutral, only internal engine loss terms dominate RPM decay. This is why free-rev drop speed and in-gear coast speed should not match exactly, and why gear 1 often slows harder on lift-off than gear 3.

A practical diagnosis shortcut is to classify the symptom by speed and state first. Very-low-speed oddities often come from launch, coupling, or idle control. Mid/high-speed pull issues usually come from torque shape, gearing, and resistance balance. Slow neutral rev-fall almost always points to rotational loss and inertia settings.

<a id="sec-2-5-torque-curve-shape-and-shift-recovery"></a>
## 2.5 Torque Curve Shape and Shift Recovery

`idle_torque`, `peak_torque`, `peak_torque_rpm`, and `redline_torque` together define the shape of the engine curve.

The new split between `[torque]` and `[torque_curve]` gives two authoring paths:

- Fast path: choose a named preset in `[torque_curve]` and optionally override only a few RPM points.
- Full-control path: provide your own RPM points directly (for example `2000rpm=220`).

If both are present, preset points are loaded first and your explicit RPM lines override matching RPMs or add new ones. This is useful when you want a stable baseline shape but still need exact behavior near shift landing RPM.

Lower `peak_torque_rpm` generally makes a vehicle easier to pull in taller gears because the strong torque band starts earlier. Higher `peak_torque_rpm` makes the vehicle feel more high-rev and can punish early upshifts if the next gear lands too low.

Higher `redline_torque` makes the vehicle continue pulling strongly near the top of each gear. Lower `redline_torque` creates a more obvious fade near the rev limiter and can be used to calm high-gear acceleration without heavily changing launch.

<a id="sec-2-5-1-torque-curve-presets-at-a-glance"></a>
## 2.5.1 Torque Curve Presets at a Glance

The built-in presets are baseline curve generators. They are not rigid classes, and they do not lock a vehicle into one behavior. Their purpose is to give you a believable starting shape quickly so you do not have to hand-author every RPM point from zero.

Under the hood, the runtime samples torque points from idle to limiter, shapes the rise to peak with `rise_exponent`, shapes the fall after peak with `fall_exponent`, and uses fallback idle/redline factors only when explicit `idle_torque` or `redline_torque` are missing. After that, your explicit `NNNNrpm` keys override matching points. This design lets you start broad and then fix only the exact RPM bands that feel wrong.

For beginners, choose a preset by "where torque should feel strongest," not by vehicle badge name. A family sedan and a compact SUV can both use the same preset if they need similar low-mid drivability. A sports coupe and a high-rev bike can both need late-ramp behavior even though they are different classes.

Preset quick meanings:

| preset | simple interpretation |
|---|---|
| `city_compact` | easy daily low-mid response, modest top-end |
| `family_sedan` | balanced and forgiving across common road speeds |
| `sport_sedan` | stronger midrange and better high-speed continuation |
| `sport_coupe` | more top-end bias than sedan presets |
| `grand_tourer` | broad, smooth pull over a wide speed range |
| `hot_hatch` | lively midrange response and quick recovery |
| `muscle_v8` | stronger low-mid push with earlier high-end softness |
| `supercar_na` | high-rev naturally aspirated behavior |
| `supercar_turbo` | boosted midrange plus solid upper pull |
| `rally_turbo` | punchy midrange focus for rapid recovery |
| `diesel_suv` | early torque and calmer high-RPM region |
| `diesel_truck` | very early torque emphasis with clear fade |
| `supersport_bike` | aggressive, peaky high-rev style |
| `naked_bike` | sporty shape with broader usable band than supersport |

<a id="sec-2-5-2-preset-selection-and-override-workflow"></a>
## 2.5.2 Preset Selection and Override Workflow

The safest workflow is to treat presets as first pass and explicit points as correction tools. Start by choosing the closest overall behavior family, then set your anchor values (`peak_torque`, `peak_torque_rpm`, and either explicit or fallback idle/redline torque). After that, run short real driving checks for launch, shift recovery, and upper-speed pull. This gives you a behavior map before you touch detailed points.

Once you identify the bad region, use explicit RPM points only in that region. If shift recovery is weak, add support around the post-shift landing RPM. If the top end is unrealistically strong, reduce points near the upper limiter band. If launch is weak despite correct gearing, strengthen the low RPM band. This targeted approach is much more stable than flattening the whole curve.

Keep manual point authoring sparse at first. Four to eight meaningful points usually outperform a dense grid of tiny edits, because dense editing often introduces noise and makes future diagnosis harder. Increase point density only when you are intentionally building a specific custom character.

Always retest after any ratio change. A torque curve that felt perfect before a `final_drive` edit can feel wrong after the edit because shift landing RPM and in-gear operating RPM moved. In other words, curve tuning and gearing tuning are linked, and they must be validated together.

<a id="sec-2-6-gears-final-drive-and-effective-ratio"></a>
## 2.6 Gears, Final Drive, and Effective Ratio

Each forward gear has its own ratio. The game multiplies that ratio by `final_drive` to get the effective ratio for wheel torque and RPM mapping.

A higher effective ratio means stronger torque multiplication but more RPM at the same road speed. A lower effective ratio means lower RPM at the same road speed and less wheel torque.

Changing `final_drive` affects every forward gear at once. This makes it one of the strongest tuning controls in the game. A small `final_drive` increase can fix weak high gears, but it can also make lower gears too aggressive and cause the vehicle to reach the rev limiter earlier. A `final_drive` decrease can calm acceleration, but it can also make upper gears feel dead if the engine does not have enough torque at the resulting RPM.

Because of this, high-gear tuning is often a combination of final drive, torque curve shape, drag, and transmission policy.

<a id="sec-2-7-drag-and-rolling-resistance"></a>
## 2.7 Drag and Rolling Resistance

Rolling resistance is a constant-like force that always fights motion. It is influenced by `rolling_resistance` and affects low, medium, and high speed, though it is usually most noticeable before aerodynamic drag becomes large.

For beginners, the easiest way to think about rolling resistance is this: it is the \"always-on drag\" from tires and road contact. Even at moderate speed, the vehicle has to spend some engine force just to keep moving. If you raise `rolling_resistance`, the vehicle may feel heavier and more reluctant to gain speed in almost every gear, not just near top speed. If you lower it too much, the vehicle may coast for too long and feel unrealistically free-rolling.

Aerodynamic drag depends on `drag_coefficient` and `frontal_area`, and it grows much more rapidly with speed. This is why a vehicle may accelerate quickly up to a point and then slowly crawl toward top speed.

The current model is more detailed than just "air drag plus tire drag". Longitudinal resistance is now built from four separate passive layers, and each layer has a different job. Aerodynamic drag is the air load and is controlled mainly by `drag_coefficient`, `frontal_area`, and optionally `side_area` when crosswind matters. Rolling resistance is the tire and road-contact baseline and is controlled by `rolling_resistance` plus `rolling_speed_factor`. Wheel-side drag is a separate always-on chassis and wheel-path loss, controlled by `wheel_side_drag_n` and `wheel_side_drag_linear_n_per_mps`, and it still applies when the engine is disconnected from the wheels. Coupled driveline drag is the transmission-side loss that only exists when a real gear path is still engaged, and it is controlled by `driveline_drag_nm` and `driveline_viscous_drag_nm_per_krpm`.

This separation matters because the game no longer treats every coast state as the same thing. Neutral coast is not supposed to feel identical to clutch-held manual coast in gear, and neither of those should feel identical to closed-throttle coupled coast. Neutral removes the selected gear path, so only aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and wheel-side drag remain. Clutch-held manual coast keeps the gear path selected, so wheel-side drag still applies and transmission-side drag can still apply, but engine-brake transfer is removed because the clutch is open. Closed-throttle coupled coast keeps everything connected, so the vehicle sees aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, wheel-side drag, coupled driveline drag, and engine-brake transfer through the current ratio.

This is also why gear-dependent coast feel is now easier to reason about. If a vehicle slows too much in every state, you usually look first at rolling resistance and wheel-side drag. If it only slows too much while coupled in gear, you usually look at engine-brake transfer and driveline drag. If it feels fine in neutral but still too free with clutch held in gear, that points to driveline drag authoring or gear-path state, not to aerodynamic drag.

This difference matters when tuning. If a vehicle feels weak from launch, through mid speed, and also near top speed, the problem is usually not aerodynamic drag alone. It is more often a combination of `power_factor`, torque curve shape, `mass_kg`, gearing, and possibly rolling resistance. If a vehicle feels fine in lower gears but loses pull mainly at high speed, then drag-related parameters (`drag_coefficient`, `frontal_area`) and high-RPM torque (`redline_torque`) become the first places to inspect.

In other words, rolling resistance mostly shapes the \"general heaviness\" of motion, while aerodynamic drag mostly shapes the \"top-speed wall\" feeling. You usually get better tuning results by deciding which of those two feelings is wrong before changing values.

This behavior is often exactly what you want for game balance. If a vehicle is too strong near top speed, increasing drag or lowering `redline_torque` is usually a clean fix. If it feels weak at all speeds, look first at `power_factor`, `mass_kg`, and gearing before blaming drag.

Practical reading examples:

1. If a car feels too free while coasting in neutral and also while coasting with clutch held, raise `wheel_side_drag_n`, `wheel_side_drag_linear_n_per_mps`, or `rolling_resistance` before touching engine-brake values.
2. If a car feels acceptable in neutral but still slows too little with clutch held in gear, inspect `driveline_drag_nm` and `driveline_viscous_drag_nm_per_krpm`.
3. If a car feels acceptable with clutch held but becomes too harsh as soon as the clutch is released, inspect `engine_braking`, `engine_braking_torque`, and `brake_transfer_efficiency`.
4. If a car pulls well in lower gears but hits a wall near top speed, inspect `drag_coefficient`, `frontal_area`, `side_area`, and upper-RPM torque shape before changing the whole gearbox.

## 2.8 Braking and Coasting

Top Speed separates active braking from lift-off slowing.

Active braking happens when the player presses the brake. The result depends mainly on `brake_strength`, grip, and the current surface.

Lift-off slowing happens when the player releases throttle. That is engine braking, controlled by `engine_braking` and `engine_braking_torque`, along with RPM, gearing, and drivetrain efficiency.

If a vehicle feels like it slows too hard when the player stops accelerating, reduce engine braking values rather than brake strength. If the actual brake button feels weak, tune `brake_strength` instead.

That high-level split is important, but the current runtime goes one step further. Brake-button stopping is now an explicit brake-force path. Natural slowing without brake input is a passive-resistance path. They are not driven by one generic "deceleration" number anymore. Passive slowing is the sum of aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, wheel-side drag, any coupled driveline drag that still exists in the current state, and engine-brake transfer if the engine is still connected to the wheels. Active braking adds brake force on top of those passive losses.

This means you should diagnose coast and braking symptoms by state, not by one generic feeling word like "slow" or "heavy". A vehicle that slows too hard only when the brake button is pressed points to `brake_strength`, surface brake effect, or tire grip. A vehicle that slows too hard on lift-off in gear points to engine-brake transfer or coupled driveline drag. A vehicle that keeps rolling too freely in neutral or with clutch held points to wheel-side drag, rolling resistance, or both.

Manual clutch behavior also deserves special attention here because it is easy to misread. In the current model, pressing clutch does not mean the vehicle becomes neutral in every sense. Neutral removes the selected gear path completely. Clutch held in a manual car keeps the selected gear path in the transmission but disconnects the engine from it. That means clutch-held coast can still keep transmission-side drag while dropping engine-brake transfer. This is why clutch-held coast should normally be stronger than pure neutral coast, but weaker than fully coupled closed-throttle coast.

Examples:

1. A manual car in gear 3 at 70 km/h with clutch held should coast more freely than fully coupled lift-off, but it should not feel as loose as pure neutral.
2. A manual car in gear 1 with clutch released and throttle lifted should usually slow harder than the same car in gear 5, because engine-brake transfer is multiplied through a shorter ratio.
3. An automatic ATC car may still show some low-speed drag and creep behavior even with light throttle changes because converter and creep logic are part of its family model, not a fake brake effect.
4. A stopping-state vehicle should now be held by explicit braking behavior, not by a hidden legacy speed bleed.

<a id="sec-2-9-steering-grip-and-stability"></a>
## 2.9 Steering, Grip, and Stability

Steering response in Top Speed is built from several parameters working together. `steering_response` acts like steering strength. `max_steer_deg` limits absolute steering angle. `wheelbase` changes how steering angle maps to path curvature. High-speed window values (`high_speed_steer_gain`, `high_speed_steer_start_kph`, `high_speed_steer_full_kph`) shape how much attenuation is applied as speed rises. Grip and dynamics parameters then decide how much of the request can actually become lateral motion.

This means handling balance should not be tuned by one value alone. If a vehicle is unrealistically agile at high speed, lowering `high_speed_steer_gain`, lowering `max_steer_deg`, or increasing `high_speed_stability` is usually the first step. If it still corners too well, lower `lateral_grip` or reduce `corner_stiffness_front` and `corner_stiffness_rear`. If it loses traction too easily under power or braking, inspect `tire_grip` and `combined_grip_penalty`.

<a id="sec-2-10-surface-behavior"></a>
## 2.10 Surface Behavior

The game applies surface-specific modifiers for asphalt, gravel, water, sand, and snow. Those modifiers interact with the vehicle baseline values.

The `surface_traction_factor` parameter still exists in the format, but it is not your main modern tuning tool for a vehicle's overall handling quality. In most cases, the most meaningful tuning for traction and cornering feel comes from `tire_grip`, `lateral_grip`, `brake_strength`, `engine_braking`, and the engine/drivetrain setup.

For beginners, this is an important trap to avoid: if a vehicle slips too much on asphalt, do not immediately start changing `surface_traction_factor`. That parameter sounds like the obvious fix, but in the current model it is more of a baseline reference than a simple \"more grip\" slider. Start with `tire_grip` for forward traction and braking grip, and use `lateral_grip` for cornering feel.

Also remember that surfaces amplify or expose weaknesses in your tune. A vehicle with too much torque and weak traction may feel acceptable on asphalt but become almost impossible to manage on gravel or wet surfaces. A vehicle with very strong engine braking may feel responsive on asphalt but feel too abrupt on low-grip surfaces. This is why surface testing is useful after the basic asphalt tune is finished.

<a id="sec-2-11-manual-vs-automatic-transmission"></a>
## 2.11 Manual vs Automatic Transmission

Transmission type now has explicit families:

- `manual`: player clutch + player shifts.
- `atc`: automatic torque-converter style family.
- `dct`: automatic dual-clutch style family.
- `cvt`: automatic continuously variable ratio family.

Each vehicle declares a `primary_type` and `supported_types` in `[transmission]`. The parser allows either one type, or two types where one is `manual` and the other is exactly one automatic family (`atc` or `dct` or `cvt`).

Manual mode allows the player to shift whenever they choose, but the clutch and stall logic now matter. With clutch released (high driveline coupling), the engine is mechanically tied to wheel speed. With clutch pressed, coupling drops and engine RPM can move more freely. At low speed with high load and insufficient throttle in manual, the engine can stall.

Automatic mode uses the selected family's coupling model and the policy system. The family model controls how coupling behaves (launch slip, lock behavior, creep, CVT ratio logic). The policy controls shift timing, delays, top-speed gear intent, and anti-hunting behavior.

ATC behavior emphasizes smoother launch and creep. It uses launch coupling bounds at very low speed, can release coupling during shifts, and can hard-lock only when lock criteria are met (speed, throttle, and low enough RPM slip). DCT behaves more directly with fast coupling and no creep, plus shift overlap coupling during shifts. CVT keeps ratio inside a configured ratio window and targets an RPM band (`target_rpm_low` to `target_rpm_high`) based on throttle.

The most important difference between the families is not just how they shift. It is how they carry loss and coupling through different states. Manual is the most explicit model: the player clutch decides whether engine-brake transfer is active, and the selected gear determines whether the transmission path still exists. If the player is in a real gear with the clutch released, the engine, gearbox, and wheels are strongly linked. If the player holds the clutch open while staying in gear, the engine is disconnected but the selected gear path still exists in the driveline. If the player moves to neutral, the selected gear path itself is removed. These are three different physical states, and they should not be tuned as if they are the same.

ATC is built to feel smoother and less abrupt than manual. Launch starts through converter-style coupling, so the engine is allowed to build usable RPM before the driveline fully hardens. Low-speed creep exists because the family can apply low-speed drive support even at very small throttle. Shift release can deliberately relax coupling during an automatic shift, and full lock depends on the family reaching its lock conditions instead of simply mirroring a manual clutch.

DCT is the most direct automatic family in the current model. It does not use a torque-converter creep style. Instead, it relies on quick clutch-style coupling and overlap behavior during shifts. That means DCT vehicles tend to feel more locked to the driveline than ATC vehicles once moving, and shift transitions can keep more driveline carry than a converter automatic. In practice, DCT should usually feel closer to a fast automated manual than to a smooth converter automatic.

CVT separates effective ratio control from coupling state. The ratio can move inside its allowed window while coupling still behaves according to launch and hold rules. That means a CVT can keep the engine inside a target RPM band without behaving like a fixed-gear automatic. The feel should be smoother in ratio progression than either ATC or DCT, but the coupling state still matters for launch softness, creep, and coast behavior.

Policy improves shift decisions, but it does not fix weak physics. If a gear cannot physically pull because torque, drag, or gearing are wrong, policy can only avoid that gear or delay entry into it.

For tuning work, manual mode is still the best diagnostic tool because it exposes raw powertrain behavior. If manual feels healthy but automatic shifts too early, hunts, or enters overdrive too soon, tune `[policy]` and the relevant `[transmission_*]` section for that automatic family.

Useful comparisons:

1. Manual in gear with clutch released: strongest engine-brake transfer and the clearest ratio-dependent lift-off behavior.
2. Manual in gear with clutch held: engine-brake transfer removed, but gear-path drag can still remain.
3. Manual in neutral: pure free-coast state with no selected gear path.
4. ATC at low speed: soft launch and possible creep behavior are normal.
5. DCT during a shift: some driveline carry during overlap is normal and should not be tuned like ATC converter slip.
6. CVT under steady throttle: engine RPM may stay inside a target band while road speed continues to rise through ratio change instead of stepped gear change.

<a id="sec-2-12-powertrain-state-and-runtime-behavior"></a>
## 2.12 Powertrain State and Runtime Behavior

The current runtime separates engine and vehicle motion into three cooperating layers so bugs can be isolated correctly. The engine-state layer resolves coupling state, automatic low-speed RPM support, and manual stall conditions. The automatic-shift layer resolves shift timing, cooldowns, transition metadata, and family-specific behaviors such as CVT forcing logic. The longitudinal-motion layer resolves actual speed change from drive force, resistance, coast, and braking.

This separation matters because similar symptoms can come from different layers. A bad shift decision can feel like weak engine torque. A coupling problem can look like a torque-curve hole. A resistance imbalance can look like a gearbox problem. Debugging is faster when you first identify which layer owns the symptom.

Recent stability work also changed neutral, clutch, and launch behavior in a way authors should know. Automatic launch support now ramps by speed and coupling instead of snapping, so RPM should no longer cliff-drop right after engagement. Clutch-disengaged manual state no longer runs driveline stall logic, so free clutch behavior is physically cleaner. Neutral free-rev lift-off now applies high-RPM overrun loss while still guarding near-idle behavior, so decay can be realistic without falling below idle.

The main runtime state distinction to remember is this: the engine state, the gear-path state, and the wheel-speed state are related but they are not identical. The engine can be disconnected from the wheels while the transmission still has a selected gear path. That is exactly what happens in a manual car when the player holds clutch while staying in gear. In that state, engine-brake transfer should disappear because the engine is no longer driving the path, but wheel-side and transmission-side passive losses can still remain because the path still exists between the rotating road wheels and the selected transmission components.

That is why the guide now uses three coast labels when describing behavior:

1. Neutral coast: no selected gear path, no engine-brake transfer, no coupled driveline drag.
2. Clutch-disengaged in gear: selected gear path still exists, engine-brake transfer removed, driveline drag may still remain.
3. Coupled closed-throttle coast: selected gear path exists and the engine is coupled strongly enough to transfer engine-brake torque.

This distinction is especially important when a vehicle seems to slow "wrong" in one gear but not another. If neutral and clutch-held coast both feel too weak, the issue is probably wheel-side or rolling resistance authoring. If neutral feels acceptable but clutch-held still feels too free, that points more directly to driveline drag authoring or gear-path state handling. If clutch-held feels acceptable but fully coupled lift-off is too harsh, the likely cause is engine-brake transfer rather than aerodynamic or wheel-side drag.

<a id="sec-2-13-engine-runtime-detailed-step-by-step"></a>
## 2.13 Engine Runtime (Detailed Step-by-Step)

This section explains how engine RPM and horsepower are actually updated each frame in the current runtime.

1. **Compute coupled RPM from speed and ratio**  
   The model converts vehicle speed + tire circumference + drive ratio into driveline-coupled RPM.

2. **Apply automatic minimum-coupled RPM floor (when active)**  
   In automatic-family driving states, launch-assist can request a minimum coupled RPM.  
   That floor is ramp-limited by `min_coupled_rise_idle_rpm_per_s` and `min_coupled_rise_full_rpm_per_s`.

3. **Select base RPM according to coupling mode**  
   - locked: use coupled RPM directly  
   - blended/disengaged: use prior/free engine RPM state as base

4. **Evaluate available engine torque from curve**  
   Torque at base RPM comes from `[torque_curve]` and core `[torque]` anchors, then scaled by `power_factor`.

5. **Apply idle-control torque when needed**  
   Near idle with low throttle, idle-control adds compensation torque using:
   - `idle_control_window_rpm`
   - `idle_control_gain_nm_per_rpm`

6. **Compute losses (friction + overrun)**  
   Loss torque includes base/linear/quadratic friction plus optional closed-throttle overrun shaping:
   - `friction_base_nm`
   - `friction_linear_nm_per_krpm`
   - `friction_quadratic_nm_per_krpm2`
   - `overrun_idle_fraction`
   - `overrun_curve_exponent`

7. **Integrate net torque through inertia**  
   Net torque is converted to RPM change via `inertia_kgm2`.  
   High inertia smooths RPM transitions; low inertia makes RPM more reactive.

8. **Blend or lock to driveline**  
   In blended states, engine RPM is mixed toward coupled RPM using `coupling_rate` and current coupling factor.

9. **Clamp and publish outputs**  
   RPM is clamped to stall/limit boundaries, then gross and net horsepower are updated.

What this means for tuning:

- weak launch but healthy midrange: inspect launch RPM support and low-RPM curve shape first
- engine hangs too long after free rev: usually too little high-RPM loss/inertia interaction
- sub-idle dip near neutral idle: usually idle-control window/gain or overrun-low-RPM balance
- harsh lift-off in gear: inspect overrun terms and `brake_transfer_efficiency`

<a id="sec-3-creating-a-custom-vehicle-package"></a>
## 3. Creating a Custom Vehicle Package

<a id="sec-3-1-folder-layout-and-discovery"></a>
## 3.1 Folder Layout and Discovery

Custom vehicles are discovered from subfolders under the `Vehicles` folder, similar to track discovery. The game searches recursively and picks the first `.tsv` file it finds in each vehicle folder (sorted by file name). The file does not need to be named `vehicle.tsv`; any `.tsv` filename is valid.

A simple example structure might look like this:

```text
Vehicles/
  TouringSedan/
    touring_sedan.tsv
    engine.wav
    start.wav
    horn.wav
    crash1.wav
    crash2.wav
    brake.wav
    backfire1.wav
    backfire2.wav
```

The vehicle selection menu uses the custom vehicle metadata name from the file (`[meta] name`) for display. The `version` and `description` values are loaded and stored, but the menu item text is based on the name.

<a id="sec-3-2-strict-file-format-rules-very-important"></a>
## 3.2 Strict File Format Rules (Very Important)

The new custom vehicle format is strict by design. There is no backward compatibility mode for legacy vehicle files.

Every parameter must be inside a supported section. Top-level parameters are rejected. Unknown sections are rejected. Unknown keys are rejected. Duplicate sections are rejected. Duplicate keys inside a section are rejected.

Errors are line-aware and explain what is wrong, which makes debugging much easier for screen-reader users than silent fallback behavior.

The format uses `key=value` lines inside sections, and comments start with `;` or `#`.

<a id="sec-3-3-required-and-optional-sections"></a>
## 3.3 Required and Optional Sections

The following sections are supported by the parser.

`[meta]`, `[sounds]`, `[general]`, `[engine]`, `[torque]`, `[engine_rot]`, `[resistance]`, `[torque_curve]`, `[transmission]`, `[drivetrain]`, `[gears]`, `[steering]`, `[tire_model]`, `[dynamics]`, `[dimensions]`, and `[tires]` are always required. `[policy]` is optional.

The parser is strict about section ownership. Keys such as `drag_coefficient` and `rolling_resistance` must be in `[resistance]`, and rotational keys such as `inertia_kgm2` must be in `[engine_rot]`. Putting valid keys in the wrong section is still an error.

`[transmission_atc]`, `[transmission_dct]`, and `[transmission_cvt]` are conditionally required based on `supported_types`:

- If `supported_types` contains `atc`, `[transmission_atc]` is required.
- If `supported_types` contains `dct`, `[transmission_dct]` is required.
- If `supported_types` contains `cvt`, `[transmission_cvt]` is required.

If one of these sections exists but the matching type is not in `supported_types`, the parser reports a warning that the section is unused.

If a required section is missing, the file fails to load and the vehicle is skipped from custom vehicle discovery.

In this example, `stop` is optional and points to a shutdown-complete sound. The game plays it only when engine shutdown fully finishes and engine RPM reaches zero.

<a id="sec-3-5-sound-path-rules-and-safety-rules"></a>
## 3.5 Sound Path Rules and Safety Rules

Custom vehicle sound paths are sandboxed to the custom vehicle folder. That means normal sound file paths must be relative paths inside the same folder as the `.tsv` file (or a subfolder under it). Paths that try to escape the folder, such as `..\\outside.wav`, are rejected. Absolute paths are also rejected for custom sound files.

This rule is important for both safety and portability. A vehicle package should be self-contained so it can be shared with other players and still work. If a sound path points to a random file elsewhere on your computer, the vehicle may work only on your machine and fail for everyone else. The folder sandbox prevents that class of problem.

The exception is built-in sound references using `builtinN`, such as `builtin1`, `builtin6`, and so on. Built-in references are allowed because they do not bypass the sandbox or access user file paths. They are useful for rapid prototyping and for authors who want to focus on physics first.

In practice, a very good beginner workflow is to build the vehicle with `builtinN` sounds first, tune the physics until it feels correct, and only then replace the sounds with custom files. This reduces the number of things you are debugging at the same time.

`crash` and `backfire` support comma-separated lists. All listed sounds are initialized when the vehicle loads, and the game randomizes among them at runtime when a crash or backfire event is played. This gives better variety without changing any physics behavior.

`stop` is a single optional sound reference (not a list). Use it when you want an explicit shutdown-complete cue after RPM has fully decayed.

<a id="sec-3-6-validation-behavior-and-error-messages"></a>
## 3.6 Validation Behavior and Error Messages

The custom vehicle parser is intentionally strict because earlier versions of the game allowed unrealistic and extreme values that made vehicles impossible to balance. The new parser validates both structure and value ranges.

If a file has a mistake, the parser produces line-aware errors. For example, it can report that a key is unknown, that `gear_ratios` does not match `number_of_gears`, or that `max_speed` is outside the allowed range. This makes it much easier to fix configuration problems without guessing.

\"Line-aware\" means the error points at the line where the problem was found, not just a generic failure message. This is especially helpful when a file is large or when a screen reader user wants to move directly to the problem area and correct one value at a time.

The parser also validates cross-parameter relationships. For example, `rev_limiter` must be between `idle_rpm` and `max_rpm`, and `peak_torque_rpm` must be between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`. `shift_freq` must stay between `idle_freq` and `top_freq`. `gear_ratios` must be non-increasing from gear 1 to the last gear.

Transmission relationships are also validated. `primary_type` must exist in `supported_types`. `supported_types` must contain either one type, or exactly two types where one is manual and one is automatic family. Only one automatic family is allowed in a vehicle file. Required type-specific sections must exist for supported automatic types, while unused type-specific sections generate warnings.

Inside type-specific sections, additional consistency checks are enforced. For example, `launch_coupling_max` must be greater than or equal to `launch_coupling_min`; in CVT, `ratio_max` must be greater than or equal to `ratio_min`, and `target_rpm_high` must be greater than or equal to `target_rpm_low`.

For `[torque_curve]`, the parser also validates section-specific rules. You must provide at least two RPM points overall, either directly or through preset plus overrides. RPM keys must use the `NNNNrpm` format (for example `2500rpm=210`), and both RPM and torque values are range-checked.

This is important because many configuration errors are not \"bad numbers\" by themselves. A value can look valid in isolation and still be invalid when compared to another value. For example, a `peak_torque_rpm` of `7000` is not wrong by itself, but it becomes wrong if the `rev_limiter` is `6500`.

This strict behavior is not a restriction for its own sake. It exists to protect creators from invalid setups and to keep the game physics within reasonable, testable ranges.

<a id="sec-3-7-practical-tuning-workflow-for-beginners"></a>
## 3.7 Practical Tuning Workflow for Beginners

The easiest way to build a good custom vehicle is to start from a clear gameplay role. Decide whether the vehicle should be a slow beginner car, a balanced sedan, a fast but hard-to-turn supercar, a van, or a bike-like high-rev vehicle. This decision helps you avoid creating a vehicle that is accidentally strong at everything.

Start by making the vehicle load and drive. Use built-in sounds if needed. Confirm it starts, moves, brakes, and shifts. After that, tune overall acceleration and top-speed behavior with `power_factor`, torque, mass, drag, gearing, and `max_speed` as the reference target. Then tune the torque curve for how it feels before and after shifts. After that, tune handling in three passes: `[steering]` for command and speed window, `[tire_model]` for grip budget and slip shape, and `[dynamics]` for transient rotation behavior. After the physics feels correct, use `[policy]` to improve automatic shifting.

Always test manual and automatic modes separately. Manual testing tells you whether the powertrain can physically pull the gears. Automatic testing tells you whether the policy is making good choices.

When something feels wrong, change one major parameter at a time. If you change power, torque, gears, drag, and steering at once, it becomes very hard to know which change actually solved the problem.

<a id="sec-4-parameter-reference-grouped-by-section"></a>
## 4. Parameter Reference (Grouped by Section)

<a id="sec-4-1-meta-section"></a>
## 4.1 `[meta]` Section

The `[meta]` section describes the vehicle package for discovery and display. All three keys are required and must be non-empty text.

### `name`

This is the display name shown in the vehicle menu for the custom vehicle. Use a clear and human-friendly name because this is what players will hear through the menu system.

There is no numeric range because this is text, but it must not be empty.

### `version`

This is the package version string. It is not currently shown in the vehicle menu item text, but it is stored and available for future display or tooling. It is useful for managing updates to your vehicle package.

There is no numeric range because this is text, but it must not be empty.

### `description`

This is a longer text description of the vehicle package. It is not currently the menu label, but it is stored and is useful for documentation, future UI improvements, and collaboration.

There is no numeric range because this is text, but it must not be empty.

<a id="sec-4-2-sounds-section"></a>
## 4.2 `[sounds]` Section

This section controls vehicle audio assets and audio pitch behavior. It does not directly change acceleration, braking, or handling. However, good sound setup is important in Top Speed because the game is audio-heavy and relies on sound feedback for gameplay clarity.

### `engine`

Main engine sound. This is required. The value may be a relative path inside the vehicle folder or a built-in reference such as `builtin6`.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. The path must resolve safely inside the vehicle folder unless it is a `builtinN` reference.

This sound usually carries most of the vehicle identity for blind players, so it is worth choosing carefully. If the physics feels right but the vehicle still feels \"wrong\" in gameplay, the engine sound pitch behavior (`idle_freq`, `top_freq`, `shift_freq`) is often the missing part.

### `start`

Engine start sound. Required. Used when the vehicle is started.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. The same path safety rules apply as `engine`.

### `stop`

Optional engine stop sound. If provided, it is played once when shutdown has fully completed and engine RPM has decayed to `0`. This gives authors a clean "engine off" cue that occurs at the end of the shutdown process, not at the moment the stop command is requested.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. If omitted, no stop sound is played. If provided, the same path safety rules apply as `engine`.

### `horn`

Horn sound. Required. Used when the horn is triggered.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. The same path safety rules apply as `engine`.

### `throttle`

Optional additional throttle layer sound. This can be left empty. When present, it adds audio richness but does not change physics.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. If you provide a non-empty value, it must resolve successfully.

This is often useful for vehicles that need a clearer sense of throttle application, turbo-like texture, or intake-style character. If your vehicle already sounds busy, leaving this empty is fine.

### `crash`

Crash sound or crash sound list. This key is required. You may provide a single sound or a comma-separated list. If you provide multiple sounds, all are initialized and one is chosen randomly at runtime for each crash event.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference or list of references. Each entry must be valid and must follow the same path safety rules. `builtinN` entries are allowed.

### `brake`

Brake sound. Required. Used for brake feedback and related tire/braking audio cues.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference. The same path safety rules apply as `engine`.

### `backfire`

Optional backfire sound or backfire sound list. If multiple entries are provided as a comma-separated list, the game randomizes among them when a backfire event is played.

There is no numeric range because this is a sound reference or list of references. If you provide entries, each must resolve successfully and follow path safety rules.

### `idle_freq`

Low engine audio pitch frequency anchor. This affects how the engine sound is pitched in low-speed and idle-like conditions.

Allowed range is 100 to 200000.

It does not change physics, but it strongly changes how slow or relaxed the vehicle sounds. If this is set too high, the vehicle may sound unnaturally \"busy\" even when moving slowly. If it is set too low, the engine may sound dull or too deep.

### `top_freq`

High engine audio pitch frequency anchor. This affects how the engine sound is pitched near the upper part of the RPM/speed range.

Allowed range is 100 to 200000, and it must be greater than or equal to `idle_freq`.

It does not change physics, but it strongly affects the perceived character of the engine. A very high `top_freq` can make a vehicle sound sharp, high-rev, or aggressive. A lower `top_freq` can make it sound heavier or less sporty.

### `shift_freq`

Intermediate audio frequency anchor used in engine pitch/shift-related sound behavior.

Allowed range is 100 to 200000, and it must be between `idle_freq` and `top_freq`.

It does not change acceleration or top speed, but poor values can make the vehicle sound inconsistent or unnatural. As a beginner rule, keep `shift_freq` somewhere between the other two values in a way that matches the vehicle character, then adjust by listening during real shifts.

### `pitch_curve_exponent`

RPM-to-pitch curve shape exponent for engine sound pitch mapping.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 1.5. If omitted, default is `0.85`.

`1.0` gives linear mapping over normalized RPM. Lower than `1.0` raises pitch earlier at lower RPM (more aggressive early rise). Higher than `1.0` delays pitch rise until later RPM.

<a id="sec-4-3-general-section"></a>
## 4.3 `[general]` Section

The `[general]` section contains general gameplay-facing values that do not fit cleanly into the engine or handling groups.

### `surface_traction_factor`

Baseline surface traction factor used by parts of the surface interaction logic.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 5.0.

This value is entered directly. Do not multiply by 100. For example, use `0.10`, not `10`.

In the current physics model this is not usually the strongest tuning lever for everyday grip feel. For meaningful traction and handling changes, `tire_grip` and `lateral_grip` are usually more important.

### `max_speed`

Forward reference speed in km/h for gameplay and automatic top-speed policy behavior.

Allowed range is 10 to 500.

This is not a strict hard cap in the current model. It is used as the main reference for top-speed behavior and transmission policy, while forward speed safety is enforced by a separate internal ceiling (`min(max_speed * 1.5, 550)` km/h).

For beginners, this should be treated as a gameplay target, not a realism promise. A real vehicle may be capable of more speed, but you can intentionally set a lower `max_speed` to protect game balance while preserving the vehicle's identity through torque, gearing, sound, and handling.

### `has_wipers`

Boolean-like flag for wiper behavior and related weather audio behavior.

This key is parsed as a boolean integer (`0` or `1`).

There is no numeric tuning range beyond that. It does not affect physics.

This is still worth setting correctly because weather audio feedback is important in an audio-based game. A road car or van will usually use `1`. Many bikes and open or non-wiper vehicles may use `0`.

<a id="sec-4-4-engine-section"></a>
## 4.4 `[engine]` Section

The `[engine]` section contains core RPM and mass/efficiency values. Torque shape is defined in `[torque]` and `[torque_curve]`. Rotational runtime controls are in `[engine_rot]`, and drag/coast controls are in `[resistance]`.

Runtime interaction summary:

- `[engine]` sets RPM boundaries and global vehicle energy context (`mass_kg`, `drivetrain_efficiency`)
- `[torque]` and `[torque_curve]` define how much gross engine torque is available at each RPM
- `[engine_rot]` controls how fast RPM moves toward that state and how lift-off/idle losses are applied
- `[resistance]` controls external road/air load opposing motion

If behavior looks inconsistent, tune in this order:

1. fix RPM range correctness in `[engine]` (`idle_rpm`, `rev_limiter`)
2. fix torque shape in `[torque]` and `[torque_curve]`
3. fix RPM transition and decay behavior in `[engine_rot]`
4. only then adjust `[resistance]` for speed-domain balancing

This order avoids masking an engine-shape problem with resistance hacks.

### `idle_rpm`

Engine idle RPM baseline.

Allowed range is 300 to 3000.

This value affects the low end of the RPM range, torque curve calculations, and how RPM-based policy fractions convert into absolute RPM. Raising it changes the meaning of some policy thresholds and can change low-speed feel.

### `max_rpm`

Maximum RPM ceiling used by the engine model for RPM handling and reporting.

Allowed range is 1000 to 20000, and it must be greater than or equal to `idle_rpm`.

This is not the same as `rev_limiter`. `max_rpm` is the overall ceiling, while `rev_limiter` is the main usable limit for power and shifting behavior.

### `rev_limiter`

Usable upper RPM limit for engine power and gear pulling.

Allowed range is 800 to 18000, and it must be between `idle_rpm` and `max_rpm`.

Lower values shorten each gear and can make high gears easier to reach but may reduce flexibility. Higher values extend each gear, but only help if the torque curve stays strong at high RPM.

### `auto_shift_rpm`

Preferred automatic shift RPM anchor.

Allowed range is 0 to 18000. It must be `0` or between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`.

A value of `0` means policy/default logic derives behavior from other values. A real value gives a direct automatic shift target and is also used when policy derives defaults.

### `engine_braking`

Engine braking strength multiplier.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.5.

This affects lift-off deceleration, not active brake-button stopping. Too high can make the vehicle feel like it drags unnaturally when the player releases throttle.

### `mass_kg`

Vehicle mass in kilograms.

Allowed range is 20 to 10000.

Higher mass reduces acceleration for the same net force and usually makes the vehicle feel calmer but heavier. Lower mass increases responsiveness and acceleration. Mass also influences some handling feel indirectly.

### `drivetrain_efficiency`

Drivetrain efficiency multiplier representing power loss through the drivetrain.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 1.0.

Higher values send more torque to the wheels. Lower values reduce acceleration and engine braking transfer. This is useful but usually not the first tuning lever for gameplay balance.

### `launch_rpm`

Launch RPM assist floor under throttle at low speed.

Allowed range is 0 to 18000, and it must not exceed `rev_limiter`.

Higher values can make launch feel stronger and reduce bogging. Lower values can calm launches.

<a id="sec-4-4-1-torque-section"></a>
## 4.4.1 `[torque]` Section

The `[torque]` section contains engine torque-shape and power scaling controls. Rotational dynamics keys are documented in `[engine_rot]`.

### `engine_braking_torque`

Base engine braking torque in Newton-meters.

Allowed range is 0 to 3000.

This works together with `engine_braking` to determine lift-off slowing. If off-throttle slowing is wrong, tune these two together.

### `peak_torque`

Peak engine torque in Newton-meters.

Allowed range is 10 to 3000.

This is one of the main acceleration parameters. Larger values usually increase acceleration across much of the speed range, especially where the engine spends time near `peak_torque_rpm`.

### `peak_torque_rpm`

RPM where peak torque occurs.

Allowed range is 500 to 18000, and it must be between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`.

Lower values improve midrange and recovery after upshifts. Higher values create a more high-rev character and can make tall gears harder to pull if shifts land too low.

### `idle_torque`

Torque near idle RPM.

Allowed range is 0 to 3000.

Higher values improve launch and low-RPM response. Too high can make the vehicle unrealistically strong in tall gears at low RPM.

### `redline_torque`

Torque near the rev limiter.

Allowed range is 0 to 3000.

This is one of the best targeted controls for high-gear pull. Lower it to calm upper-gear acceleration without heavily affecting low-speed launch. Raise it to let the engine continue pulling harder at high RPM.

### `power_factor`

Global power scaling multiplier for throttle-driven acceleration calculations.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 2.0.

This is one of the best gameplay-balance controls in the entire format. It lets you adjust acceleration without fully rebuilding the torque curve. If a vehicle is too dominant, lowering `power_factor` is often the cleanest first step.

<a id="sec-4-4-2-torque-curve-section"></a>
## 4.4.2 `[torque_curve]` Section

The `[torque_curve]` section defines explicit torque points by RPM and optionally a base preset. This section is required.

### `preset`

Optional named base shape loaded before any explicit RPM points.

Allowed values are:

- `city_compact`
- `family_sedan`
- `sport_sedan`
- `sport_coupe`
- `grand_tourer`
- `hot_hatch`
- `muscle_v8`
- `supercar_na`
- `supercar_turbo`
- `rally_turbo`
- `diesel_suv`
- `diesel_truck`
- `supersport_bike`
- `naked_bike`

Use this when you want a stable baseline quickly, then override only a few RPM points for vehicle-specific character.

### `NNNNrpm`

Per-RPM torque points using keys like `2000rpm=220`.

RPM key range is 300 to 25000. Torque value range is 0 to 5000 Nm.

You must end with at least two total points in `[torque_curve]`. If you only use `preset`, that requirement is satisfied by preset points. If you do not use a preset, you must provide at least two explicit RPM lines.

When preset and explicit points are both present, explicit points win at matching RPM and add new points where no preset point exists.

<a id="sec-4-4-3-transmission-section"></a>
## 4.4.3 `[transmission]` Section

The `[transmission]` section defines transmission families available to the vehicle and which one starts as default.

### `primary_type`

Default active transmission type for the vehicle.

Allowed values are `atc`, `cvt`, `dct`, `manual`.

This value must also appear inside `supported_types`.

### `supported_types`

Comma-separated list of supported transmission types.

Allowed tokens are `atc`, `cvt`, `dct`, `manual`.

Validation rules:

- At least one type is required.
- At most two types are allowed.
- If two types are provided, they must be exactly one manual type plus exactly one automatic family type.
- Only one automatic family is allowed per vehicle.
- Duplicate types are rejected.

If `supported_types` includes an automatic family, the matching type-specific section becomes required:

- `atc` requires `[transmission_atc]`.
- `dct` requires `[transmission_dct]`.
- `cvt` requires `[transmission_cvt]`.

### `shift_on_demand`

Optional boolean-like key (`true`/`false` or `0`/`1`) that enables manual up/down shift control while an automatic family is active.

Default is `false` when omitted.

When enabled and active in gameplay, automatic upshift/downshift policy is bypassed until shift-on-demand mode is turned off. If no automatic family is present in `supported_types`, this key is accepted but ignored and the parser emits a warning.

<a id="sec-4-4-4-transmission-atc-section"></a>
## 4.4.4 `[transmission_atc]` Section

ATC (automatic torque-converter style) driveline coupling parameters. This section is required when `supported_types` includes `atc`.

### `creep_accel_kphps`

Low-speed creep acceleration in km/h per second when throttle is near zero and brake is not pressed.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 12.0.

### `launch_coupling_min`

Minimum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with zero throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `launch_coupling_max`

Maximum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with full throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0 and must be greater than or equal to `launch_coupling_min`.

### `lock_speed_kph`

Speed threshold where ATC may request full lock coupling.

Allowed range is 2.0 to 300.0.

### `lock_throttle_min`

Minimum throttle needed for ATC full-lock request above lock speed.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `shift_release_coupling`

Coupling target while a shift is in progress.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `engage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling increase toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

### `disengage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling decrease toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

ATC notes: ATC can creep, and it uses controlled pre-lock coupling before hard lock criteria are satisfied. In runtime, hard lock is still gated by speed/throttle/coupling/slip conditions to avoid abrupt RPM behavior.

<a id="sec-4-4-5-transmission-dct-section"></a>
## 4.4.5 `[transmission_dct]` Section

DCT (dual-clutch automatic) driveline coupling parameters. This section is required when `supported_types` includes `dct`.

### `launch_coupling_min`

Minimum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with zero throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `launch_coupling_max`

Maximum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with full throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0 and must be greater than or equal to `launch_coupling_min`.

### `lock_speed_kph`

Speed threshold where DCT may request full lock coupling.

Allowed range is 2.0 to 300.0.

### `lock_throttle_min`

Minimum throttle needed for DCT full-lock request above lock speed.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `shift_overlap_coupling`

Coupling target while shifting to model overlap behavior.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `engage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling increase toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

### `disengage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling decrease toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

DCT notes: DCT has no automatic creep in this model and generally behaves more directly than ATC at low speed.

<a id="sec-4-4-6-transmission-cvt-section"></a>
## 4.4.6 `[transmission_cvt]` Section

CVT driveline and ratio-control parameters. This section is required when `supported_types` includes `cvt`.

### `ratio_min`

Minimum effective CVT ratio.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 8.0.

### `ratio_max`

Maximum effective CVT ratio.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 10.0 and must be greater than or equal to `ratio_min`.

### `target_rpm_low`

Low end of the CVT RPM target band.

Allowed range is `idle_rpm` to `rev_limiter`.

### `target_rpm_high`

High end of the CVT RPM target band.

Allowed range is `idle_rpm` to `rev_limiter` and must be greater than or equal to `target_rpm_low`.

### `ratio_change_rate`

How quickly CVT ratio moves toward target ratio.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 20.0.

### `launch_coupling_min`

Minimum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with zero throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `launch_coupling_max`

Maximum coupling factor used at launch-region speed with full throttle.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0 and must be greater than or equal to `launch_coupling_min`.

### `lock_speed_kph`

Speed threshold where CVT may request full lock coupling.

Allowed range is 2.0 to 300.0.

### `lock_throttle_min`

Minimum throttle needed for CVT full-lock request above lock speed.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `creep_accel_kphps`

Low-speed creep acceleration in km/h per second when throttle is near zero and brake is not pressed.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 12.0.

### `shift_hold_coupling`

Coupling target used while shifting/transitioning.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

### `engage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling increase toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

### `disengage_rate`

Rate limit for coupling decrease toward target.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

CVT notes: CVT dynamically selects ratio inside `[ratio_min, ratio_max]` to hold engine RPM in the target band according to throttle demand.

<a id="sec-4-5-drivetrain-section"></a>
## 4.5 `[drivetrain]` Section

The `[drivetrain]` section contains gearing and braking controls that are not part of the engine torque curve itself.

### `final_drive`

Final drive ratio applied to all forward gears.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 8.0.

This is one of the strongest tuning controls because it changes effective gearing in every forward gear. Increasing it makes all gears shorter and usually improves pull. Decreasing it makes all gears taller and can reduce acceleration or make upper gears harder to use.

Because it affects every gear, `final_drive` is often the fastest way to move a vehicle in the right direction, but it can also create side effects very quickly. A change that fixes weak 7th gear might make 1st and 2nd gear too aggressive. A change that calms launch might make top-speed gears impossible to pull.

For beginners, a good rule is to use `final_drive` for broad changes and `gear_ratios` for fine shaping. If the whole vehicle feels too short or too tall, change `final_drive`. If only one or two gears feel wrong, adjust the gear ratio list.

### `reverse_max_speed`

Maximum reverse speed in km/h.

Allowed range is 1 to 100.

The game clamps reverse speed separately from forward speed. This gives you direct control over how fast the vehicle can back up.

### `reverse_power_factor`

Reverse acceleration scaling multiplier.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 2.0.

This is a gameplay tuning value. Most vehicles should use a lower reverse power value than forward power to keep reverse behavior controllable.

### `reverse_gear_ratio`

Reverse gear ratio.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 8.0.

This affects reverse RPM and reverse torque multiplication together with `final_drive` and `reverse_power_factor`.

### `brake_strength`

Active braking strength multiplier used when the brake input is pressed.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 5.0.

This works with grip and surface behavior. If brake input feels weak, increase this. If braking is too harsh or difficult to control, reduce it.

<a id="sec-4-6-gears-section"></a>
## 4.6 `[gears]` Section

This section defines the number of forward gears and the exact gear ratio list. Both keys are required.

### `number_of_gears`

Number of forward gears.

Allowed range is 1 to 10.

This value must match the number of entries in `gear_ratios`. The parser hard-fails if they do not match.

### `gear_ratios`

Comma-separated list of forward gear ratios, one value per gear from 1st to last.

This key is required. There is no fallback or auto-generation in the custom vehicle format.

Each individual ratio must be between 0.20 and 8.00. The list must be non-increasing, which means each later gear must be the same or lower ratio than the previous one.

Higher values make shorter gears with stronger torque multiplication. Lower values make taller gears with less pull and lower RPM at the same speed. Gear ratios always interact with `final_drive`, so tune them together.

For beginner tuning, think of the gear list as the shape of the acceleration experience. Early gears control launch and low-speed response. Middle gears control the most common acceleration feel during normal driving and racing. Late gears control high-speed pull and overdrive behavior.

If an upshift causes the engine to drop into a weak RPM zone, the next gear may be too tall, the previous gear may be too short, the final drive may be too low, or the torque curve may not support that RPM. The fix is not always \"change that one ratio only.\" Always test the effect on the gears before and after it.

<a id="sec-4-7-steering-section"></a>
## 4.7 `[steering]` Section

The `[steering]` section controls steering command generation and speed-window behavior before tire-force and yaw dynamics are applied.

### `steering_response`

Steering strength multiplier.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 5.0.

This is one of the main first-pass handling controls. Raising it increases steering authority in the full speed range. Lowering it makes steering calmer and less immediate.

If steering feels weak at low and medium speed, this is usually the first value to increase. If steering feels nervous at all speeds, reduce this before touching advanced parameters.

### `high_speed_stability`

High-speed stability damping factor for lateral response.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values calm the vehicle at speed and reduce twitchiness, especially when combined with high grip and short wheelbase setups. Too high can make the vehicle feel reluctant to rotate in fast corners.

This value should not be used as a complete substitute for proper grip and dynamics tuning. It is best used as a speed-domain stabilizer, not as a universal "fix steering" knob.

### `high_speed_steer_gain`

High-speed steering boost factor applied on top of the built-in speed attenuation.

Allowed range is 0.7 to 1.6.

In the current shared model, steering is attenuated as speed rises. `high_speed_steer_gain` does not override that attenuation. It only boosts or trims the attenuated result.

Practically, this means even high values are controlled. Most realistic tunes should stay near `0.85` to `0.98` and use `high_speed_stability`, tire grip, and dynamics values for additional control.

### `high_speed_steer_start_kph`

Speed where high-speed steering attenuation and gain blending starts.

Allowed range is 60 to 260.

Below this speed, high-speed attenuation is not active. Lower start values make high-speed behavior begin earlier in normal driving.

### `high_speed_steer_full_kph`

Speed where high-speed attenuation and gain blending is fully applied.

Allowed range is 100 to 350, and must be greater than `high_speed_steer_start_kph`.

Between start and full speed, the game blends smoothly from base steering to the high-speed steering scale. A narrow window creates faster transition. A wide window creates a more gradual transition.

### `wheelbase`

Wheelbase in meters.

Allowed range is 0.3 to 8.0.

Shorter wheelbase usually feels more responsive and more willing to rotate. Longer wheelbase usually feels calmer and less agile. It interacts strongly with `steering_response`, `max_steer_deg`, and corner stiffness balance.

For beginners, wheelbase is easy to misunderstand because it does not feel like a direct \"more turning\" or \"less turning\" knob. Instead, it changes how strongly the same steering angle bends the vehicle path. That means it changes the character of steering, not only the amount.

### `max_steer_deg`

Maximum steering angle in degrees.

Allowed range is 5 to 60.

This is one of the most direct handling controls. Lower values are useful for limiting the agility of high-speed vehicles. Higher values improve maneuverability but can make the vehicle unstable if grip and stability are too high.

<a id="sec-4-8-tire-model-section"></a>
## 4.8 `[tire_model]` Section

The `[tire_model]` section controls grip budget sharing, slip-angle shape, and mass/aero influence. These values define steady-state cornering behavior and how much traction remains while turning.

### `tire_grip`

Base tire grip coefficient for traction and braking, with influence on overall grip behavior.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 3.0.

This primarily affects acceleration traction and braking authority, but it also contributes to total grip behavior under combined load. If vehicles spin wheels too easily or feel weak under braking, this is a primary parameter.

### `lateral_grip`

Additional lateral grip tuning for turning behavior.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 3.0.

This is the main cornering-grip scalar. Raise for stronger corner hold, lower for more drift/slip character. If turning feels too weak while traction feels fine, tune this before torque values.

### `combined_grip_penalty`

How strongly lateral demand reduces available longitudinal traction.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values create stronger trade-off between turning and acceleration/braking. Lower values allow stronger acceleration while cornering. This is a core realism-versus-arcade balance control.

### `slip_angle_peak_deg`

Slip-angle peak reference in degrees for the simplified tire response.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 20.0.

Lower values reach the peak earlier and can feel sharp but unforgiving. Higher values make slip build more gradually and can feel easier to control.

### `slip_angle_falloff`

Falloff scale after the peak slip angle.

Allowed range is 0.01 to 5.0.

Higher falloff values drop force faster after the peak, which increases punishment for over-driving steering input. Lower values keep more force after peak and feel more forgiving.

### `turn_response`

Lateral response-time scaling.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 2.5.

This scales how quickly lateral output follows the steering/lateral state. Low values can feel delayed or heavy. High values feel immediate but may become twitchy if damping is too low.

### `mass_sensitivity`

How much vehicle mass influences turn agility.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

At higher values, heavy vehicles lose agility more clearly while light vehicles preserve responsiveness. At lower values, classes feel closer together regardless of mass.

### `downforce_grip_gain`

Speed-dependent grip gain factor.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 1.0.

Higher values add more grip as speed increases. This is useful for high-performance classes but can make high-speed behavior too dominant if combined with high `high_speed_steer_gain`.

If high-speed cornering is too strong, reduce this or reduce high-speed steering gain before reducing low-speed steering values.

<a id="sec-4-9-dynamics-section"></a>
## 4.9 `[dynamics]` Section

The `[dynamics]` section controls transient behavior: how quickly yaw builds, how steering input is shaped, and how front/rear axle authority is balanced. These values are required.

### `corner_stiffness_front`

Front axle cornering stiffness scale.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 3.0.

Higher values increase front lateral force build-up and can improve turn-in authority. Too high can create front-end bite that feels abrupt.

Relative balance matters more than absolute value. Front greater than rear generally favors stable turn-in with mild understeer tendency at the limit.

### `corner_stiffness_rear`

Rear axle cornering stiffness scale.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 3.0.

Higher values increase rear lateral authority and can help rotation. Too high relative to front can create oversteer-like rotation that is hard to recover.

For safe baseline tuning, keep rear slightly below front. For more rotation-oriented setups, narrow the gap carefully.

### `yaw_inertia_scale`

Yaw inertia multiplier applied to rotational response.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 2.0.

Higher values make yaw build and change more slowly, which feels heavier and more stable. Lower values make yaw change faster, which feels agile but can become nervous.

This parameter is especially important for class identity. Bikes and lightweight vehicles usually need lower values than heavy trucks and buses.

### `steering_curve`

Input shaping exponent for steering command.

Allowed range is 0.5 to 2.0.

Values below `1.0` make early input stronger and feel more aggressive around small steering taps. Values above `1.0` make early input softer and reserve more authority for larger inputs.

If players report that light taps cause too much response, increase this value slightly. If small taps feel dead, reduce this value slightly.

### `transient_damping`

Damping factor for lateral/yaw transients.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 6.0.

Higher values suppress oscillation and reduce overshoot after steering changes. Lower values allow freer response and stronger immediate rotation.

If vehicles keep rotating after steering release, increase this value. If vehicles feel slow to rotate or "stuck," reduce it carefully and retest with `turn_response`.

<a id="sec-4-10-dimensions-section"></a>
## 4.10 `[dimensions]` Section

The `[dimensions]` section defines physical size values used for spatial behavior and representation.

### `vehicle_width`

Vehicle width in meters.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 5.0.

This affects spatial/audio placement and vehicle size behavior, not engine power or top speed directly.

Even though it is not a power parameter, it still matters for how the vehicle feels in an audio game. Width contributes to spatial presence and how wide the vehicle seems relative to lanes and nearby traffic or objects.

### `vehicle_length`

Vehicle length in meters.

Allowed range is 0.3 to 20.0.

This also affects spatial representation and presence rather than direct acceleration physics.

For beginners, this should generally reflect the actual body length of the vehicle type you are creating, even if you are not trying to be perfectly realistic. A value that is far too short or far too long can make the vehicle feel spatially \"wrong\" even when the engine and handling are tuned well.

<a id="sec-4-11-tires-section"></a>
## 4.11 `[tires]` Section

The `[tires]` section defines tire circumference directly or provides the size triplet needed to calculate it.

You must provide either a valid `tire_circumference` or all three of `tire_width`, `tire_aspect`, and `tire_rim`. The parser hard-fails if neither form is complete and valid.

### `tire_circumference`

Tire circumference in meters.

If provided and greater than zero, it is used directly. Allowed range is 0.2 to 5.0 meters.

This value affects the speed-to-RPM relationship. Incorrect tire circumference can make gearing and RPM behavior feel wrong even when other parameters are correct.

This is one of the easiest hidden causes of confusing tuning problems. If tire circumference is too small, the engine RPM will appear higher than expected at a given speed, which can make gears seem shorter than they really are. If it is too large, RPM may seem too low and gears may feel too tall.

### `tire_width`

Tire width in millimeters used for circumference calculation when direct circumference is not provided.

Allowed range is 20 to 450.

This value is only used when circumference is being calculated from tire size. It does not act as a direct grip parameter in the current custom format. Use `tire_grip` and `lateral_grip` for actual handling tuning.

### `tire_aspect`

Tire aspect ratio (sidewall height percentage of tire width) used for circumference calculation fallback.

Allowed range is 5 to 150.

This is also used only for circumference calculation fallback, not as a direct handling-physics grip knob.

### `tire_rim`

Rim diameter in inches used for circumference calculation fallback.

Allowed range is 4 to 30.

This is also used only for circumference calculation fallback. If you already know tire circumference, providing `tire_circumference` directly is usually simpler and reduces mistakes.

If you provide the size triplet, the game calculates tire circumference automatically after validation.

<a id="sec-4-12-policy-section"></a>
## 4.12 `[policy]` Section (Optional, Automatic Transmission Only)

The `[policy]` section controls automatic shifting behavior. It does not change engine power, grip, or drag directly. Policy should be used after the vehicle can physically pull the gears you intend it to use.

The parser accepts normal policy keys and also wildcard delay keys such as `upshift_delay_6_7` and `upshift_delay_g6`.

### `top_speed_gear`

Intended forward gear for reaching the game-world top speed.

Allowed range is 1 to `number_of_gears`.

This is especially important for 7-speed and 8-speed vehicles with overdrive gears. It tells automatic mode which gear should usually be treated as the main top-speed gear.

For example, an 8-speed vehicle may be designed to reach the game top speed in 6th gear, while 7th and 8th are calmer cruising or overdrive gears. Declaring that intention in policy helps automatic mode avoid entering those higher gears too early.

### `allow_overdrive_above_game_top_speed`

Boolean policy flag for allowing gears above `top_speed_gear` near or above the top-speed region.

This key has no numeric range because it is boolean. Use `true` or `false`.

If `true`, automatic mode can use higher gears as overdrives when appropriate. If `false`, it avoids them while pursuing top speed.

This setting does not make the overdrive gear physically usable by itself. It only changes whether automatic mode is allowed to choose it. If overdrive gears still feel dead in manual mode, fix torque, drag, or gearing first.

### `base_auto_shift_cooldown`

Base automatic shift cooldown in seconds.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 2.0.

Higher values make automatic mode calmer and less likely to shift rapidly. Too high can make the transmission feel lazy.

This is a good first control for automatic behavior because it improves stability without changing the underlying powertrain. If the automatic mode feels nervous or chatters between gears, try a small increase here before changing several other policy values.

### `upshift_delay_default`

Default automatic upshift delay in seconds.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 2.0.

This is a useful way to make upshifts slower in general before adding special delays for high gears.

### `upshift_delay_X_Y`

Per-transition upshift delay in seconds for a specific adjacent upshift.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 2.0.

Use keys such as `upshift_delay_5_6=0.18` or `upshift_delay_6_7=0.24`. This is the best way to make high-gear upshifts slower without affecting lower gears.

### `upshift_delay_gX`

Per-source-gear shorthand upshift delay in seconds.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 2.0.

For example, `upshift_delay_g6=0.24` applies to upshifts out of 6th gear. Explicit transition keys are more specific and should be preferred when you need exact behavior.

### `auto_upshift_rpm_fraction`

Automatic upshift threshold as a fraction of the RPM span from idle to rev limiter.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 1.0.

This is convenient because it stays meaningful even if you later retune `idle_rpm` or `rev_limiter`.

### `auto_upshift_rpm`

Automatic upshift threshold in absolute RPM.

Allowed range is 0 to the vehicle RPM limits used by validation. In practice it must be `0` or between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`.

This overrides the fraction-style threshold when present.

### `auto_downshift_rpm_fraction`

Automatic downshift threshold as a fraction of the RPM span from idle to rev limiter.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 0.95.

Higher values make the transmission more eager to downshift. Lower values make it hold higher gears longer.

### `auto_downshift_rpm`

Automatic downshift threshold in absolute RPM.

Allowed range is 0 or a valid RPM between `idle_rpm` and `rev_limiter`.

This overrides the fraction-style downshift threshold when present.

### `top_speed_pursuit_speed_fraction`

Threshold for when the automatic logic considers the vehicle near the top-speed region, expressed as a fraction of game `max_speed` reference speed.

Allowed range is 0.50 to 1.20.

Values below `1.0` let the policy begin top-speed behavior before the vehicle reaches its `max_speed` reference target. This is useful for stable high-gear behavior near terminal speed.

### `upshift_hysteresis`

Extra hysteresis for automatic upshift decisions.

Allowed range is 0.0 to 2.0.

Higher values reduce gear hunting but can delay good shifts. Lower values make shifting more responsive but can increase oscillation.

### `min_upshift_net_accel_mps2`

Minimum acceptable net acceleration in the next gear before an upshift is allowed, unless top-speed pursuit logic decides otherwise.

Allowed range is -20.0 to 20.0.

This is an important anti-stall protection for high gears. It helps prevent automatic mode from shifting into a gear that would immediately decelerate or feel dead.

For beginners, the exact unit (`m/s²`) is less important than the effect: it is a \"do not upshift if the next gear is too weak\" rule. If automatic mode enters high gears too early and the vehicle falls flat, this parameter is one of the most useful policy controls to review.

### `prefer_intended_top_speed_gear_near_limit`

Boolean policy flag for preferring the intended top-speed gear near the speed limit region.

This key has no numeric range because it is boolean. Use `true` or `false`.

When enabled, automatic mode tries to stay in or below the intended top-speed gear until it is appropriate to use overdrives.

<a id="sec-4-13-engine-rot-section"></a>
## 4.13 `[engine_rot]` Section

The `[engine_rot]` section defines engine rotational behavior, RPM coupling behavior, and overrun/loss shaping. This section is required.

### `inertia_kgm2`

Engine rotational inertia in kg*m^2.

Allowed range is 0.01 to 5.0.

Higher values make RPM rise/fall slower and smoother. Lower values make RPM react quickly to throttle/lift changes.

### `coupling_rate`

Blend rate between free engine RPM integration and wheel-coupled RPM.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 80.0.

Higher values lock blended RPM to driveline demand faster. Lower values allow more slip behavior before lock.

### `friction_base_nm`

Base parasitic friction torque in Newton-meters.

Allowed range is 0 to 1000.

Raises internal loss everywhere. Too high can make free-rev and lift-off feel heavy.

### `friction_linear_nm_per_krpm`

Linear friction growth per 1000 RPM.

Allowed range is 0 to 1000.

Use this when high-RPM losses should rise proportionally with RPM.

### `friction_quadratic_nm_per_krpm2`

Quadratic friction growth per (1000 RPM)^2.

Allowed range is 0 to 1000.

Use this for stronger high-RPM loss shaping near top revs.

### `idle_control_window_rpm`

Idle-control activation window above idle RPM.

Allowed range is 0 to 1000.

Within this window (with low throttle), idle-control torque can hold RPM stable instead of dropping too low.

### `idle_control_gain_nm_per_rpm`

Idle-control proportional gain in Nm per RPM deficit.

Allowed range is 0 to 2.

Higher values recover idle faster. Too high can make off-throttle near-idle feel artificial.

### `min_coupled_rise_idle_rpm_per_s`

Minimum automatic coupled-RPM rise rate at zero throttle.

Allowed range is 0 to 20000.

This limits how abruptly launch-assist RPM floors can jump at low throttle.

### `min_coupled_rise_full_rpm_per_s`

Minimum automatic coupled-RPM rise rate at full throttle.

Allowed range is 0 to 20000, and it must be greater than or equal to `min_coupled_rise_idle_rpm_per_s`.

Higher values allow faster launch RPM build under high throttle.

### `overrun_idle_fraction`

Closed-throttle overrun-loss fraction at idle end of RPM range.

Allowed range is 0 to 1.

Higher values increase low-RPM overrun losses; lower values keep low-RPM lift-off gentler.

### `overrun_curve_exponent`

Shape exponent for overrun-loss growth from idle toward limiter.

Allowed range is 0.2 to 5.0.

Higher values push more overrun effect toward higher RPM. Lower values spread it more evenly.

### `brake_transfer_efficiency`

Engine-brake torque transfer efficiency to wheels.

Allowed range is 0.1 to 1.0.

Higher values increase lift-off decel transfer through gearing. Lower values soften engine-brake effect at wheels.

<a id="sec-4-14-resistance-section"></a>
## 4.14 `[resistance]` Section

The `[resistance]` section defines the passive road and air loads that oppose motion. This section is required.

Think of this section as the owner of non-brake, non-combustion longitudinal loss. It does not define engine power and it does not define active brake button force. Instead, it defines what the vehicle has to fight against while moving. In the current model, these keys are split into aerodynamic load, tire-road rolling load, wheel-side passive loss, and selected-gear driveline loss. That split is intentional, because neutral coast, clutch-held coast, and fully coupled lift-off no longer share one fake generic deceleration value.

In practical terms, the section behaves like this. `drag_coefficient`, `frontal_area`, and `side_area` shape air load. `rolling_resistance` and `rolling_speed_factor` shape tire-road load. `wheel_side_drag_n` and `wheel_side_drag_linear_n_per_mps` shape always-on passive wheel/chassis loss that survives even when the engine is disconnected. `driveline_drag_nm` and `driveline_viscous_drag_nm_per_krpm` shape transmission-side loss that only matters when a real gear path remains engaged.

### `drag_coefficient`

Aerodynamic drag coefficient.

Allowed range is 0.01 to 1.5.

Main high-speed drag tuning lever.

### `frontal_area`

Frontal area in square meters.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 10.0.

Works with `drag_coefficient`; larger area increases high-speed drag.

### `side_area`

Side area in square meters.

Allowed range is 0.05 to 20.0.

This is used for crosswind-sensitive aerodynamic load. It is usually not the first top-speed tuning lever, but it matters when environmental wind and exposed body shape should create extra resistance.

### `rolling_resistance`

Rolling resistance coefficient.

Allowed range is 0.001 to 0.1.

Mostly affects low/mid-speed "always-on" resistance feel.

### `rolling_speed_factor`

Speed-dependent multiplier applied on top of the base rolling-resistance term.

Allowed range is 0 to 1.0.

This makes rolling resistance grow with speed instead of staying perfectly flat. Use it to add "heavier at speed" tire and contact-patch feel without using aerodynamic drag for everything.

### `wheel_side_drag_n`

Base wheel-side resistance force in newtons.

Allowed range is 0 to 5000.

This is always-on passive rolling loss that still applies during neutral coast or with the clutch fully disengaged.

### `wheel_side_drag_linear_n_per_mps`

Speed-dependent wheel-side resistance slope in newtons per meter per second.

Allowed range is 0 to 200.

Higher values increase passive free-coast slowdown as vehicle speed rises, without depending on engine braking or coupled driveline drag.

### `driveline_drag_nm`

Base coupled driveline drag torque in newton-meters.

Allowed range is 0 to 2000.

This is transmission-side drag that only matters while a real gear path is still engaged. It is a good place to tune the difference between neutral coast and clutch-held manual coast without using engine braking.

### `driveline_viscous_drag_nm_per_krpm`

Speed-dependent coupled driveline drag slope in newton-meters per 1000 RPM.

Allowed range is 0 to 500.

Higher values make coupled driveline loss grow with transmission speed. This is especially useful when clutch-held in-gear coast or automatic-family coupled coast is too free at higher road speed even though neutral coast already feels correct.

<a id="sec-4-15-torque-curve-preset-profiles"></a>
## 4.15 Torque Curve Preset Profiles

This section documents intended behavior of `[torque_curve] preset` values. Use these as starting points, then override with explicit `NNNNrpm` keys where needed.

Preset coefficients used by the runtime:

| preset | rise_exponent | fall_exponent | idle_factor | redline_factor | practical character |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `city_compact` | 1.00 | 1.55 | 0.42 | 0.58 | modest peak, practical low-mid |
| `family_sedan` | 1.05 | 1.35 | 0.38 | 0.64 | balanced and forgiving |
| `sport_sedan` | 1.15 | 1.25 | 0.34 | 0.70 | broader mid-high pull |
| `sport_coupe` | 1.24 | 1.18 | 0.32 | 0.74 | more top-end bias |
| `grand_tourer` | 1.08 | 1.16 | 0.36 | 0.73 | broad high-speed pull |
| `hot_hatch` | 1.10 | 1.28 | 0.35 | 0.68 | lively midrange response |
| `muscle_v8` | 0.90 | 1.22 | 0.44 | 0.66 | stronger low-mid character |
| `supercar_na` | 1.34 | 1.10 | 0.28 | 0.77 | naturally aspirated high-rev |
| `supercar_turbo` | 0.88 | 1.40 | 0.34 | 0.66 | boosted midrange + top pull |
| `rally_turbo` | 0.86 | 1.38 | 0.36 | 0.64 | punchy boost-oriented midrange |
| `diesel_suv` | 0.80 | 1.90 | 0.50 | 0.56 | early heavy torque, calmer top |
| `diesel_truck` | 0.66 | 2.05 | 0.58 | 0.52 | very early torque and clear fade |
| `supersport_bike` | 1.62 | 1.14 | 0.26 | 0.69 | very peaky high-rev behavior |
| `naked_bike` | 1.45 | 1.20 | 0.30 | 0.67 | sporty but broader than supersport |

Practical preset selection matrix:

| if your target feel is... | first preset to try | common first override zone |
|---|---|---|
| calm launch, smooth everyday response | `family_sedan` | raise/trim 1500 to 2800 RPM |
| lively city acceleration without supercar top-end | `hot_hatch` | smooth 1800 to 3500 RPM |
| strong low-mid push, less high-rev focus | `muscle_v8` | trim 4500 RPM to limiter |
| high-rev naturally aspirated pull | `supercar_na` | support 3500 to 5500 RPM landings |
| turbo-like midrange surge | `supercar_turbo` or `rally_turbo` | smooth 2200 to 4200 RPM boost band |
| heavy diesel-like early torque and early fade | `diesel_suv` or `diesel_truck` | reduce very-low RPM spikes under 1500 |
| very peaky bike behavior | `supersport_bike` | ensure enough torque below 5000 RPM for driveability |

How to read the columns:

- higher `rise_exponent`: slower torque climb early, more late ramp toward peak (peaky feel)
- lower `rise_exponent`: earlier low-mid torque build (stronger out of lower RPM)
- higher `fall_exponent`: holds near peak longer before dropping close to limiter
- lower `fall_exponent`: begins fading earlier after peak
- higher `idle_factor`: stronger torque floor if `idle_torque` is omitted
- higher `redline_factor`: stronger top-end if `redline_torque` is omitted

Important: `idle_factor` and `redline_factor` are only fallback multipliers. If you set `idle_torque` and `redline_torque` explicitly, those explicit values dominate.

Preset tuning workflow in one pass:

1. choose one preset only
2. set anchors (`peak_torque`, `peak_torque_rpm`, `idle_torque`, `redline_torque`)
3. add minimal explicit points around launch RPM, common shift-landing RPM, and upper pull/fade RPM
4. verify with launch, midrange, and top-speed pull checks
5. if behavior is still far off, switch preset family before overfitting many manual points

<a id="sec-5-class-baseline-presets"></a>
## 5. Class Baseline Presets (Steering, Tire Model, Dynamics)

This section provides practical starting presets by class for the modern handling model. These are not hard rules. They are baseline values that should produce a stable first drive and then be refined for each specific vehicle.

The values below intentionally use only `[steering]`, `[tire_model]`, and `[dynamics]` fields.

Recommended classes in this guide:

- Sports Car: fast and responsive, but with controlled high-speed steering authority.
- Sedan/Hatchback: balanced daily-driver behavior.
- SUV/Truck/Van: heavier and calmer directional behavior.
- Motorcycle: agile but less forgiving, especially at speed.

### Steering Baselines (`[steering]`)

| Class | steering_response | high_speed_stability | high_speed_steer_gain | high_speed_steer_start_kph | high_speed_steer_full_kph | wheelbase | max_steer_deg |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sports Car | 1.08 to 1.30 | 0.22 to 0.30 | 0.92 to 0.98 | 145 to 165 | 235 to 260 | 2.50 to 2.90 | 30 to 35 |
| Sedan/Hatchback | 0.98 to 1.20 | 0.25 to 0.34 | 0.88 to 0.95 | 125 to 150 | 210 to 240 | 2.55 to 2.95 | 30 to 36 |
| SUV/Truck/Van | 0.84 to 1.08 | 0.34 to 0.50 | 0.84 to 0.91 | 85 to 120 | 150 to 200 | 2.80 to 3.50 | 28 to 36 |
| Motorcycle | 0.92 to 1.08 | 0.42 to 0.50 | 0.88 to 0.93 | 140 to 160 | 225 to 245 | 1.35 to 1.55 | 34 to 42 |

### Tire Model Baselines (`[tire_model]`)

| Class | tire_grip | lateral_grip | combined_grip_penalty | slip_angle_peak_deg | slip_angle_falloff | turn_response | mass_sensitivity | downforce_grip_gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sports Car | 0.95 to 1.15 | 0.98 to 1.12 | 0.64 to 0.72 | 7.5 to 8.8 | 1.12 to 1.28 | 0.95 to 1.15 | 0.60 to 0.75 | 0.06 to 0.12 |
| Sedan/Hatchback | 0.88 to 1.02 | 0.92 to 1.02 | 0.66 to 0.74 | 8.3 to 9.6 | 1.22 to 1.40 | 0.90 to 1.08 | 0.68 to 0.82 | 0.03 to 0.08 |
| SUV/Truck/Van | 0.75 to 0.92 | 0.78 to 0.92 | 0.50 to 0.65 | 9.5 to 11.5 | 1.40 to 1.70 | 0.80 to 0.98 | 0.80 to 0.95 | 0.00 to 0.05 |
| Motorcycle | 1.04 to 1.20 | 0.76 to 0.90 | 0.74 to 0.84 | 6.0 to 7.2 | 0.90 to 1.08 | 1.05 to 1.28 | 0.40 to 0.62 | 0.05 to 0.11 |

### Dynamics Baselines (`[dynamics]`)

| Class | corner_stiffness_front | corner_stiffness_rear | yaw_inertia_scale | steering_curve | transient_damping |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Sports Car | 1.08 to 1.25 | 1.00 to 1.15 | 0.90 to 1.08 | 0.90 to 1.00 | 0.85 to 1.15 |
| Sedan/Hatchback | 0.94 to 1.08 | 0.90 to 1.02 | 1.05 to 1.25 | 1.02 to 1.18 | 1.30 to 1.90 |
| SUV/Truck/Van | 0.72 to 0.92 | 0.65 to 0.85 | 1.35 to 1.70 | 1.12 to 1.30 | 2.00 to 2.90 |
| Motorcycle | 1.30 to 1.55 | 0.90 to 1.05 | 0.52 to 0.70 | 0.72 to 0.88 | 0.80 to 1.05 |

### How to Apply Baselines Safely

1. Pick one class baseline and apply all three groups (`[steering]`, `[tire_model]`, `[dynamics]`) together.
2. Run low-speed checks first (30 to 80 km/h) to verify direction, turn-in, and release behavior.
3. Run high-speed checks (160 to 240 km/h) and adjust `high_speed_steer_gain`, `high_speed_stability`, and `downforce_grip_gain` first.
4. If response is too weak, increase `steering_response` or `turn_response` slightly before raising grip.
5. If response is too aggressive, raise `transient_damping` or `steering_curve` slightly before reducing grip.

### Quick Class Correction Guide

- Sports Car corners too hard at high speed: lower `high_speed_steer_gain`, reduce `downforce_grip_gain`, or slightly raise `high_speed_stability`.
- Sedan feels dead in normal turns: raise `steering_response` by a small amount, then raise `turn_response` only if needed.
- SUV rotates too quickly: raise `yaw_inertia_scale` and `transient_damping`, then reduce `corner_stiffness_rear`.
- Motorcycle feels too safe and planted: reduce `high_speed_stability` slightly and lower `yaw_inertia_scale` toward class baseline.

<a id="sec-6-what-was-removed-from-the-old-format"></a>
## 6. What Was Removed From the Old Format

The new custom format removes several legacy behaviors on purpose.

`mono_crash` sound support is removed and is not a valid parameter. `steering_factor` is also removed and is not supported. If either appears in a custom `.tsv` file, the parser will reject the file as unknown-key input.

Legacy coast and slowdown keys are also removed from the custom format and should not appear in new files. `deceleration` is no longer a valid physics authoring key. `coast_base_mps2` and `coast_linear_per_mps` are also not part of the current format. The current model replaces those old generic slowdown controls with explicit `[resistance]` authoring using rolling resistance, wheel-side drag, and coupled driveline drag. If an old vehicle file still uses the removed keys, the correct fix is to retune the new resistance keys rather than trying to preserve the old generic-decay behavior.

The old divide-by-100 convention is also removed. Do not write encoded values such as `17000` for 170 km/h or `180` for `steering_response=1.8`. Use direct values everywhere.

Top-level parameters are no longer supported. Every key must be inside a valid section.

<a id="sec-7-tuning-advice-and-common-problems"></a>
## 7. Tuning Advice and Common Problems

If a vehicle is too fast in every gear, lowering only `max_speed` will not fix the real problem. The vehicle will still accelerate too hard and just reach the top-speed region earlier. In that case, reduce `power_factor`, reduce torque values, increase mass, adjust gearing, or increase drag depending on which part of the speed range is too strong.

If a vehicle feels fine at launch but weak after an upshift, inspect where the new gear lands on the torque curve. Lowering `peak_torque_rpm`, increasing `idle_torque`, shortening gearing, increasing final drive, or reducing drag can all improve shift recovery. Policy can help avoid bad automatic shifts, but it cannot make a weak gear physically stronger.

If a vehicle turns too well for its class, reduce `high_speed_steer_gain`, `max_steer_deg`, or `steering_response` first. If it is still too strong in corners, reduce `lateral_grip`, reduce corner stiffness values, or increase `high_speed_stability`. If it becomes hard to control under braking or acceleration, revisit `tire_grip`, `combined_grip_penalty`, and braking values.

If automatic mode feels worse than manual mode, the physics may already be good. In that case, tune `[policy]` instead of rebuilding the engine and gears. Use `top_speed_gear`, `upshift_delay_*`, and acceleration-protection policy values to stabilize behavior.

<a id="sec-8-final-notes-for-authors"></a>
## 8. Final Notes for Authors

The new `.tsv` format is strict because strictness improves quality, debugging, and fairness. It prevents accidental bad values, catches mistakes early, and makes custom vehicles much easier to maintain.

The best results come from clear goals and methodical tuning. Decide the vehicle role first, make sure the powertrain can physically pull the intended gears, then refine balance with `power_factor`, drag, handling limits, and automatic transmission policy. Test in manual and automatic modes, and pay close attention to what happens immediately after each shift. That moment usually reveals whether your tune is healthy.
